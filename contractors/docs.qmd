## EOC or LOSB?
You do not need both an EOC and a LOSB number. An LOSB certificate qualifies as an EOC certificate.

LOSB contractors currently receive exclusive first preference to bid on rehab projects within the city of Memphis. Note that this LOSB preference will be going away in the coming months.
