## New to Bidding?
We allow all contractors with a [valid EOC number](docs.qmd#EOC) the opportunity to bid on our projects. However, additional documents are required for the bid to be accepted. If you are a contractor interested in working with us, please review the [required documents](docs.qmd) for our program, create an account on [Neighborly](https://portal.neighborlysoftware.com/SHELBYCOUNTYTN/contractor), and upload these documents. Bids are conducted through Neighborly.
