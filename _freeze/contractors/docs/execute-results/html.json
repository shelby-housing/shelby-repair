Then, you must apply to receive the certificate through the EPA.\n\nTo get started, click \"Apply Now\" on the [EPA lead certification page](https://www.epa.gov/lead/getcertified).\n\nNext, enter your firm name, phone number, and address to search for your firm in the database. If you are recertifying, your business should appear in the database. Select \"Open\" next to your firm's information, and select \"Recertify Renovation firm (\\$300 for 5-year certification)\".\n\nIf it is your first time applying, after searching in the database a link will appear below the search that says \"Begin application to certify a 'New Firm'. A pop-up window will ask you which certification you wish to apply for. For an RRP certification, select \"New Renovation firm (\\$300 for 5-year certification)\".\n\nAfter selecting a certification and clicking \"Continue\", you will be directed to the **CDX Register/Log In** page. If you have previously used CDX, enter your username and password (or recover your information if you have forgotten your login.) If this is your first time, select \"Register\".\n\nUsers will then be asked to enter all states/territories where they plan to do renovation work. This page verifies that the EPA certification will allow you to do RRP work in that state.\n\nNew users will then be asked to enter their information to register for an account. Existing users can simply enter their job title and phone number in the information section. You can also select a firm already associated with your account, or you can choose \"Associate a new firm with your account\".\n\n:::{.callout-warning collapse=TRUE}\n## Application warning message\nIf you have submitted an application within the last 30 days, a warning message will appear. Select \"I want to sign my previous application\" to resume the application process. If you are taken to a page that says \"You do not currently have any incomplete/outstanding submissions\", your previous submission was successfully signed and no further action is required.\n\nSelecting \"I want to complete and pay for another application\" to begin a new application if, for example, two branches of a business require seperate certifications. This option will require users to pay the full fee for a new application.\n\nSelect \"Take me back to the EPA website\" to exit the application.\n:::\n\nNext, users will be taken to the **Firm Information** page. For returning users, this section will be pre-populated. Verify the name and address, and enter an email and phone number.\n\nFor new users, search for your firm by entering at least three characters. If your firm is listed, select it and verify the information. If your business is not listed, click \"Can't Find your Firm?\" and select \"Create My Own\" to create a new firm. Please note that P.O. Boxes are not accepted for business addresses. You can enter a P.O. Box in the mailing address later in the form.\n\nOnce the form is completed, you will be sent an **email verification**. Click the link in the email to verify your email address and resume the application.\n\nOn the **Review and Payment** page, verify your information and edit if needed. Under the payment section, the total cost for certification will be displayed. Select a payment method and enter your payment information. For new users, you will be asked to enter the last four digits of your social security number for identity proofing. Provide the SSN of the person whose name is associated with the CDX account, and not the cardholder, if the two are different.\n\nUnder the certification section, read the terms and check both boxes. Then, select \"Sign and Pay\". You will be asked to enter your CDX password, and click \"Continue\".\n\nA **\"Processing Request\"** popup will appear, and may take a few minutes to process. **Do not close this window** while the system is processing to avoid duplicate charges.\n\nAfter the system has finished processing, you will see a page confirming that your application is complete and will be reviewed by the EPA. You will also receive a confirmation email from lead.paint@epa.gov.\n\nOnce the application is approved, the certificate will be emailed to the address on file. \n\nSee the [lead training](lead-training.qmd) page for more information on RRP classes.\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\nThe certificate submitted to us must be issued by the EPA. A certificate for completing the RRP training class is not sufficient.\n:::\n\n<details><summary>View an example EPA RRP Certificate.</summary>\n<embed src=\"../examples/EPA.pdf\" width=\"830\" height=\"600\" \n type=\"application/pdf\">\n</details>\n\n### TDEC Lead Firm Certificate {#TDEC}\n\n::: {.callout-warning appearance=\"simple\"}\nThe TDEC Lead Firm Certificate is only required for lead projects.\n:::\n\nContractors must complete LBP Worker and Supervisor classes before applying for a Firm certificate. Apply for a Firm certificate from the [State of Tennessee](https://www.tn.gov/environment/toxic-substances-program/lead-hazard-program/lead-certification.html).\n\nSee the [lead training](lead-training.qmd) page for more information on classes.\n\n<details><summary>View an example TDEC Lead Firm Certificate.</summary>\n<embed src=\"../examples/TDEC.pdf\" width=\"600\" height=\"830\" \n type=\"application/pdf\">\n</details>\n \n",
