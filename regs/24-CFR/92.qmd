# Subpart A—General

## § 92.1 Overview. {#sec-1}

This part implements the HOME Investment Partnerships Act (the HOME Investment Partnerships Program). In general, under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, HUD allocates funds by formula among eligible State and local governments to strengthen public-private partnerships and to expand the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, with primary attention to rental housing, for very low-income and low-income families. Generally, HOME funds must be matched by nonfederal resources. State and local governments that become participating jurisdictions may use HOME funds to carry out multi-year housing strategies through acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of housing, and tenant-based rental assistance. Participating jurisdictions may provide assistance in a number of eligible forms, including loans, advances, equity investments, interest subsidies and other forms of investment that HUD approves.

## § 92.2 Definitions. {#sec-2}

[ADDI funds](){#def-ADDI-funds} means funds made available under subpart M through allocations and reallocations. 

Adjusted income. See [§ 92.203](#sec-203). 

Annual income. See [§ 92.203](#sec-203). 

[CDBG program](){#def-CDBG-program} means the Community Development Block Grant program under 24 CFR part 570. 

[Certification](){#def-certification} shall have the meaning provided in section 104(21) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 12704. 

[Commitment](){#def-commitment} means: 

(1) The participating jurisdiction has executed a legally binding written agreement (that includes the date of the signature of each person signing the agreement) that meets the minimum requirements for a written agreement in [§ 92.504(c)](#sec-504-c). An agreement between the participating jurisdiction and a subrecipient that is controlled by the participating jurisdiction (e.g., an agency whose officials or employees are official or employees of the participating jurisdiction) does not constitute a commitment. An agreement between the representative unit and a member unit of general local government of a consortium does not constitute a commitment. Funds for administrative and planning costs of the HOME program are committed based on the amount in the program disbursement and information system for administration and planning. The written agreement must be: 

    (i) With a State recipient or a subrecipient to use a specific amount of HOME funds to produce affordable housing, provide downpayment assistance, or provide tenant-based rental assistance; 

    (ii) With a community housing development organization to provide operating expenses; 

    (iii) With a community housing development organization to provide project-specific technical assistance and site control loans or project-specific seed money loans, in accordance with [§ 92.301](#sec-301); 

    (iv) To develop the capacity of community housing development organizations in the jurisdiction, in accordance with [§ 92.300(b)](#sec-300-b); or 

    (v) To commit to a specific local project, as defined in paragraph (2) of this definition. 

(2) Commit to a specific local project  means: 

    (i) If the project consists of rehabilitation or new construction (with or without acquisition) the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or sub recipient) and project owner have executed a written legally binding agreement under which HOME assistance will be provided to the owner for an identifiable project for which all necessary financing has been secured, a budget and schedule have been established, and underwriting has been completed and under which construction is scheduled to start within twelve months of the agreement date. If the project is owned by the participating jurisdiction or State recipient, the project has been set up in the disbursement and information system established by HUD, and construction can reasonably be expected to start within twelve months of the project set-up date. 

    (ii)

          (A) If the project consists of acquisition of standard housing and the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) is acquiring the property with HOME funds, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) and the property owner have executed a legally binding contract for sale of an identifiable property and the property title will be transferred to the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) within six months of the date of the contract. 

          (B) If the project consists of acquisition of standard housing and the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) is providing HOME funds to a family to acquire single family housing for homeownership or to a purchaser to acquire rental housing, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) and the family or purchaser have executed a written agreement under which HOME assistance will be provided for the purchase of the single family housing or rental housing and the property title will be transferred to the family or purchaser within six months of the agreement date. 

    (iii) If the project consists of tenant-based rental assistance, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient, or subrecipient) has entered into a rental assistance contract with the owner or the tenant in accordance with the provisions of [§ 92.209](#sec-209).

[Community housing development organization](){#def-CHDO} means a private nonprofit organization that: 

(1) Is organized under State or local laws; 

(2) Has no part of its net earnings inuring to the benefit of any member, founder, contributor, or individual; 

(3) Is neither controlled by, nor under the direction of, individuals or entities seeking to derive profit or gain from the organization. A community housing development organization may be sponsored or created by a for-profit entity, but: 

    (i) The for-profit entity may not be an entity whose primary purpose is the development or management of housing, such as a builder, developer, or real estate management firm. 

    (ii) The for-profit entity may not have the right to appoint more than one-third of the membership of the organization's governing body. Board members appointed by the for-profit entity may not appoint the remaining two-thirds of the board members; 

    (iii) The community housing development organization must be free to contract for goods and services from vendors of its own choosing; and 

    (iv) The officers and employees of the for-profit entity may not be officers or employees of the community housing development organization. 

(4) Has a tax exemption ruling from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 CFR 1.501(c)(3)–1 or 1.501(c)(4)–1)), is classified as a subordinate of a central organization non-profit under section 905 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or if the private nonprofit organization is an wholly owned entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for tax purposes (e.g., a single member limited liability company that is wholly owned by an organization that qualifies as tax-exempt), the owner organization has a tax exemption ruling from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and meets the definition of “community housing development organization;” 

(5) Is not a governmental entity (including the participating jurisdiction, other jurisdiction, Indian tribe, public housing authority, Indian housing authority, housing finance agency, or redevelopment authority) and is not controlled by a governmental entity. An organization that is created by a governmental entity may qualify as a community housing development organization; however, the governmental entity may not have the right to appoint more than one-third of the membership of the organization's governing body and no more than one- third of the board members may be public officials or employees of governmental entity. Board members appointed by a governmental entity may not appoint the remaining two-thirds of the board members. The officers or employees of a governmental entity may not be officers or employees of a community housing development organization; 

(6) Has standards of financial accountability that conform to 2 CFR 200.302, ‘Financial Management’ and 2 CFR 200.303, ‘Internal Controls;’ 

(7) Has among its purposes the provision of decent housing that is affordable to low-income and moderate-income persons, as evidenced in its charter, articles of incorporation, resolutions or by-laws; 

(8) Maintains accountability to low-income community residents by: 

    (i) Maintaining at least one-third of its governing board's membership for residents of low-income neighborhoods, other low-income community residents, or elected representative of low-income neighborhood organizations. For urban areas, “community” may be a neighborhood or neighborhoods, city, county or metropolitan area; for rural areas, it may be a neighborhood or neighborhoods, town, village, county, or multi-county area (but not the entire State); and 

    (ii) Providing a formal process for low-income program beneficiaries to advise the organization in its decisions regarding the design, siting, development, and management of affordable housing; 

(9) Has a demonstrated capacity for carrying out housing projects assisted with HOME funds. A designated organization undertaking development activities as a developer or sponsor must satisfy this requirement by having paid employees with housing development experience who will work on projects assisted with HOME funds. For its first year of funding as a community housing development organization, an organization may satisfy this requirement through a contract with a consultant who has housing development experience to train appropriate key staff of the organization. An organization that will own housing must demonstrate capacity to act as owner of a project and meet the requirements of [§ 92.300(a)(2)](){#sec-300-a-2}. A nonprofit organization does not meet the test of demonstrated capacity based on any person who is a volunteer or whose services are donated by another organization; and 

(10) Has a history of serving the community within which housing to be assisted with HOME funds is to be located. In general, an organization must be able to show one year of serving the community before HOME funds are reserved for the organization. However, a newly created organization formed by local churches, service organizations or neighborhood organizations may meet this requirement by demonstrating that its parent organization has at least a year of serving the community. 

[Consolidated plan](){#def-consolidated-plan} means the plan submitted and approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 91.

The term first-time homebuyer also includes an individual who is a displaced homemaker or single parent, as those terms are defined in this section. An individual shall not be excluded from consideration as a first-time homebuyer on the basis that the individual owns or owned, as a principal residence during the three-year period, a dwelling unit whose structure is not permanently affixed to a permanent foundation in accordance with local or other applicable regulations or is not in compliance with State, local, or model building codes, or other applicable codes, and cannot be brought into compliance with the codes for less than the cost of constructing a permanent structure. 

[HOME funds](){#def-HOME-funds} means funds made available under this part through allocations and reallocations, plus program income.

(3) The ownership interest may be subject only to the restrictions on resale required under [§ 92.254(a)](#sec-254-a); mortgages, deeds of trust, or other liens or instruments securing debt on the property as approved by the participating jurisdiction; or any other restrictions or encumbrances that do not impair the good and marketable nature of title to the ownership interest. 

(4) The participating jurisdiction must determine whether or not ownership or membership in a cooperative or mutual housing project constitutes homeownership under State law; however, if the cooperative or mutual housing project receives Low Income Housing Tax Credits, the ownership or membership does not constitute homeownership.

    (v) Reflects the person's need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic care, treatment, or other services that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this definition, the term “person with disabilities” includes two or more persons with disabilities living together, one or more such persons living with another person who is determined to be important to their care or well-being, and the surviving member or members of any household described in the first sentence of this definition who were living, in a unit assisted with HOME funds, with the deceased member of the household at the time of his or her death. 

[Program income](){#def-program-income} means gross income received by the participating jurisdiction, State recipient, or a subrecipient directly generated from the use of HOME funds or matching contributions. When program income is generated by housing that is only partially assisted with HOME funds or matching funds, the income shall be prorated to reflect the percentage of HOME funds used. Program income includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

(1) Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property acquired, rehabilitated, or constructed with HOME funds or matching contributions;

[Project](){#def-project} means a site or sites together with any building (including a manufactured housing unit) or buildings located on the site(s) that are under common ownership, management, and financing and are to be assisted with HOME funds as a single undertaking under this part. The project includes all the activities associated with the site and building. For tenant-based rental assistance, project means assistance to one or more families.

For tenant-based rental assistance, project completion means the final drawdown has been disbursed for the project. 

[Reconstruction](){#def-reconstruction} means the rebuilding, on the same lot, of housing standing on a site at the time of project commitment, except that housing that was destroyed may be rebuilt on the same lot if HOME funds are committed within 12 months of the date of destruction. The number of housing units on the lot may not be decreased or increased as part of a reconstruction project, but the number of rooms per unit may be increased or decreased. Reconstruction also includes replacing an existing substandard unit of manufactured housing with a new or standard unit of manufactured housing. Reconstruction is rehabilitation for purposes of this part.

The unit must contain either food preparation or sanitary facilities (and may contain both) if the project consists of new construction, conversion of nonresidential space, or reconstruction. For acquisition or rehabilitation of an existing residential structure or hotel, neither food preparation nor sanitary facilities are required to be in the unit. If the units do not contain sanitary facilities, the building must contain sanitary facilities that are shared by tenants. A project's designation as an SRO cannot be inconsistent with the building's zoning and building code classification. 

[State](){#def-state} means any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any agency or instrumentality thereof that is established pursuant to legislation and designated by the chief executive officer to act on behalf of the state with regard to the provisions of this part; however, for purposes of the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) described in subpart M of this part, the term “state” does not include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (except for FY2003 ADDI funds).

[Subrecipient](){#def-subrecipient} means a public agency or nonprofit organization selected by the participating jurisdiction to administer all or some of the participating jurisdiction's HOME programs to produce affordable housing, provide downpayment assistance, or provide tenant-based rental assistance. A public agency or nonprofit organization that receives HOME funds solely as a developer or owner of a housing project is not a subrecipient. The participating jurisdiction's selection of a subrecipient is not subject to the procurement procedures and requirements. 

[Tenant-based rental assistance](){#def-TBRA} is a form of rental assistance in which the assisted tenant may move from a dwelling unit with a right to continued assistance. Tenant-based rental assistance under this part also includes security deposits for rental of dwelling units. 

[Transitional housing](){#def-transitional-housing} means housing that: 

(1) Is designed to provide housing and appropriate supportive services to persons, including (but not limited to) deinstitutionalized individuals with disabilities, homeless individuals with disabilities, and homeless families with children; and

When a county is an urban county, the urban county is the unit of general local government for purposes of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. 

[Urban county](){#def-urban-county} has the meaning given the term in 24 CFR 570.3. 

[Very low-income families](){#def-very-low-income-families} means low- income families whose annual incomes do not exceed 50 percent of the median family income for the area, as determined by HUD with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that HUD may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 50 percent of the median for the area on the basis of HUD findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs or fair market rents, or unusually high or low family incomes. An individual does not qualify as a very low-income family if the individual is a student who is not eligible to receive Section 8 assistance under [24 CFR 5.612](5.qmd#sec-612). 

## § 92.3 Applicability of 2013 regulatory changes. {#sec-3}

## § 92.4 Waivers and suspension of requirements for disaster areas. {#sec-4}

HUD's authority for waiver of regulations and for the suspension of requirements to address damage in a Presidentially declared disaster area is described in 24 CFR 5.110 and in section 290 of the Act, respectively.

# Subpart B—Allocation Formula

## § 92.50 Formula allocation. {#sec-50}

### (a) Jurisdictions eligible for a formula allocation. {#sec-50-a}

HUD will provide allocations of funds in amounts determined by the formula described in this section to units of general local governments that, as of the end of the previous fiscal year, are metropolitan cities, urban counties, or consortia approved under [§ 92.101](#sec-101); and States. 

### (b) Amounts available for allocation; State and local share. {#sec-50-b}

The amount of funds that are available for allocation by the formula under this section is equal to the balance of funds remaining after reserving amounts for insular areas, housing education and organizational support, other support for State and local housing strategies, and other purposes authorized by Congress, in accordance with the Act and appropriations. 

### (c) Formula factors. {#sec-50-c}

The formula for determining allocations uses the following factors. The first and sixth factors are weighted 0.1; the other four factors are weighted 0.2.

[(1)](){#sec-50-c-1} Vacancy-adjusted rental units where the household head is at or below the poverty level. These rental units are multiplied by the ratio of the national rental vacancy rate over a jurisdiction's rental vacancy rate. 

[(2)](){#sec-50-c-2} Occupied rental units with at least one of four problems (overcrowding, incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing, or high rent costs). Overcrowding is a condition that exists if there is more than one person per room occupying the unit. Incomplete kitchen facilities means the unit lacks a sink with running water, a range, or a refrigerator. Incomplete plumbing means the unit lacks hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, or a bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the occupants of the unit. High rent costs occur when more than 30 percent of household income is used for rent. 

[(3)](){#sec-50-c-3} Rental units built before 1950 occupied by poor households. 

[(4)](){#sec-50-c-4} Rental units described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section multiplied by the ratio of the cost of producing housing for a jurisdiction divided by the national cost. 

[(5)](){#sec-50-c-5} Number of families at or below the poverty level. 

[(6)](){#sec-50-c-6} Population of a jurisdiction multiplied by a net per capita income (pci). To compute net pci for a jurisdiction or for the nation, the pci of a three person family at the poverty threshold is subtracted from the pci of the jurisdiction or of the nation. The index is constructed by dividing the national net pci by the net pci of a jurisdiction. 

### (d) Calculating formula allocations for units of general local government. {#sec-50-d}

[(1)](){#sec-50-d-1} Initial allocation amounts for units of general local government described in paragraph (a) of this section are determined by multiplying the sum of the shares of the six factors in paragraph (c) of this section by 60 percent of the amount available under paragraph (b) of this section for formula allocation. The shares are the ratio of the weighted factor for each jurisdiction over the corresponding factor for the total for all of these units of general local government. 

[(2)](){#sec-50-d-2} If any of the initial amounts for such units of general local government in Puerto Rico exceeds twice the national average, on a per rental unit basis, that amount is capped at twice the national average. 

[(3)](){#sec-50-d-3} To determine the maximum number of units of general local government that receive a formula allocation, only one jurisdiction (the unit of general local government with the smallest allocation of HOME funds) is dropped from the pool of eligible jurisdictions on each successive recalculation, except that jurisdictions that are participating jurisdictions (other than consortia that fail to renew the membership of all of their member jurisdictions) are not dropped. Then the amount of funds available for units of general local government is redistributed to all others. This recalculation/redistribution continues until all remaining units of general local government receive an allocation of \$500,000 or more or are participating jurisdictions. Only units of general local government which receive an allocation of \$500,000 or more under the formula or which are participating jurisdictions will be awarded an allocation. In fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than \$1.5 billion of HOME funds, \$335,000 is substituted for $500,000. 

[(4)](){#sec-50-d-4} The allocation amounts determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section are reduced by any amounts that are necessary to provide increased allocations to States that have no unit of general local government receiving a formula allocation (see paragraph (e)(4) of this section). These reductions are made on a pro rata basis, except that no unit of general local government allocation is reduced below \$500,000 (or \$335,000 in fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than \$1.5 billion of HOME funds) and no participating jurisdiction allocation which is below this amount is reduced. 

### (e) Calculating formula allocations for States. {#sec-50-e}

[(1)](){#sec-50-e-1} Forty percent of the funds available for allocation under paragraph (b) of this section are allocated to States. The allocation amounts for States are calculated by determining initial amounts for each State, based on the sum of the shares of the six factors. For 20 percent of the funds to be allocated to States, the shares are the ratio of the weighted factor for the entire State over the corresponding factor for the total for all States. For 80 percent of the funds to be allocated to States, the shares are the ratio of the weighted factor for all units of general local government within the State that do not receive a formula allocation over the corresponding factor for the total for all States. 

[(2)](){#sec-50-e-2} If the initial amounts for Puerto Rico (based on either or both the 80 percent of funds or 20 percent of funds calculation) exceed twice the national average, on a per rental unit basis, each amount that exceeds the national average is capped at twice the national average, and the resultant funds are reallocated to other States on a prorata basis. 

[(3)](){#sec-50-e-3} If the initial amounts when combined for any State are less than the \$3,000,000, the allocation to that State is increased to the \$3,000,000 and all other State allocations are reduced by an equal amount on a prorata basis, except that no State allocation is reduced below $3,000,000. 

[(4)](){#sec-50-e-4} The allocation amount for each State that has no unit of general local government within the State receiving an allocation under paragraph (d) of this section is increased by \$500,000. Funds for this increase are derived from the funds available for units of general local government, in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

## § 92.60 Allocation amounts for insular areas. {#sec-60}

### (a) Initial allocation amount for each insular area. {#sec-60-a}

The initial allocation amount for each insular area is determined based upon the insular area's population and occupied rental units compared to all insular areas. 

### (b) Threshold requirements. {#sec-60-b}

The HUD Field Office shall review each insular area's progress on outstanding allocations made under this section, based on the insular area's performance report, the timeliness of close-outs, and compliance with fund management requirements and regulations, taking into consideration the size of the allocation and the degree and complexity of the program. If HUD determines from this review that the insular area does not have the capacity to administer effectively a new allocation, or a portion of a new allocation, in addition to allocations currently under administration, HUD may reduce the insular area's initial allocation amount. 

### (c) Previous audit findings and outstanding monetary obligations. {#sec-60-c}

HUD shall not make an allocation to an insular area that has either an outstanding audit finding for any HUD program, or an outstanding monetary obligation to HUD that is in arrears, or for which a repayment schedule has not been established. This restriction does not apply if the HUD Field Office finds that the insular area has made a good faith effort to clear the audit and, when there is an outstanding monetary obligation to HUD, the insular area has made a satisfactory arrangement for repayment of the funds due HUD and payments are current. 

### (d) Increases to the initial allocation amount. {#sec-60-d}

If funds reserved for the insular areas are available because HUD has decreased the amount for one or more insular areas in accordance with paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, or for any other reason, HUD may increase the allocation amount for one or more of the remaining insular areas based upon the insular area's performance in committing HOME funds within the 24 month deadline, producing housing units described in its program description, and meeting HOME program requirements. Funds that become available but which are not used to increase the allocation amount for one or more of the remaining insular areas will be reallocated in accordance with [§ 92.66](#sec-66). 

### (e) Notice of allocation amounts. {#sec-60-e}

HUD will notify each insular area, in writing, as to the amount of its HOME allocation. 

## § 92.61 Program description. {#sec-61}

### (a) Submission requirement. {#sec-61-a}

Not later than 90 days after HUD notifies the insular area of the amount of its allocation, the insular area must submit a program description and certifications to HUD. 

### (b) Content of program description. {#sec-61-b}

The program description must contain the following: 

(1) An executed Standard Form 424; 

(2) The estimated use of HOME funds and a description of projects and eligible activities, including number of units to be assisted, estimated costs, and tenure type (rental or owner occupied) and, for tenant assistance, number of households to be assisted; 

(3) A timetable for the implementation of the projects or eligible activities; 

(4) If the insular area intends to use HOME funds for homebuyers, the guidelines for resale or recapture as required in [§ 92.254(a)(5)](#sec-254-a-5); 

(5) If the insular area intends to use HOME funds for tenant-based rental assistance, a description of how the program will be administered consistent with the minimum guidelines described in [§ 92.209](#sec-209); 

(6) If an insular area intends to use other forms of investment not described in [§ 92.205(b)](#sec-205-b), a description of the other forms of investment; 

(7) A statement of the policy and procedures to be followed by the insular area to meet the requirements for affirmative marketing, and establishing and overseeing a minority and women business outreach program under [§ 92.351](#sec-351); 

(8) If the insular intends to use HOME funds for refinancing along with rehabilitation, the insular area's guidelines described in [§ 92.206(b)](#sec-206-b). 

### (c) Certifications. {#sec-61-c}

The following certifications must accompany the program description: 

(1) A certification that, before committing funds to a project, the insular area will evaluate the project in accordance with guidelines that it adopts for this purpose and will not invest any more HOME funds in combination with other governmental assistance than is necessary to provide affordable housing; 

(2) If the insular area intends to provide tenant-based rental assistance, the certification required by [§ 92.209](#sec-209); 

(3) A certification that the submission of the program description is authorized under applicable law and the insular area possesses the legal authority to carry out the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, in accordance with the HOME regulations; 

(4) A certification that it will comply with the acquisition and relocation requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24 and the requirements of [§ 92.353](#sec-353); 

(5) A certification that the insular area will use HOME funds in compliance with all requirements of this part; 

(6) The certification required with regard to lobbying required by 24 CFR part 87, together with disclosure forms, if required by 24 CFR part 87. 

## § 92.62 Review of program description and certifications. {#sec-62}

### (a) Review of program description.  

The responsible HUD Field Office will review an insular area's program description and will approve the description unless the insular area has failed to submit information sufficient to allow HUD to make the necessary determinations required for § 92.61 (b)(4), (b)(6), and (b)(7), or the guidelines under (b)(8) are not satisfactory to HUD, if applicable; or if the level of proposed projects or eligible activities is not within the management capability demonstrated by past performance in housing and community development programs. If the insular area has not submitted information on § 92.61 (b)(4), (b)(6), and (b)(7), or the guidelines under (b)(8) are not satisfactory to HUD, if applicable; or if the level of proposed projects or eligible activities is not within the management capability demonstrated by past performance in housing and community development programs, the insular area may be required to furnish such further information or assurances as HUD may consider necessary to find the program description and certifications satisfactory. The HUD Field Office shall work with the insular area to achieve a complete and satisfactory program description. 

### (b) Review period.  

Within thirty days of receipt of the program description, the HUD Field Office will notify the insular area if determinations cannot be made under § 92.61 (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(7), or (b)(8) with the supporting information submitted, or if the proposed projects or activities are beyond currently demonstrated capability. The insular area will have a reasonable period of time, agreed upon mutually, to submit the necessary supporting information or to revise the proposed projects or activities in its program description. 

### (c) HOME Investment Partnership Agreement.  

After HUD Field Office approval under this section, a HOME funds allocation is made by HUD execution of the agreement, subject to execution by the insular area. The funds are obligated on the date HUD notifies the insular area of HUD's execution of the agreement. 

## § 92.63 Amendments to program description. {#sec-63}

An insular area must submit to HUD for approval any substantial change in its HUD-approved program description that it makes and must document any other changes in its file. A substantial change involves a change in the guidelines for resale or recapture (§ 92.61(b)(4)), other forms of investment (§ 92.61(b)(6)), minority and women business outreach program (§ 92.61(b)(7)) or refinancing (§ 92.61(b)(8)); or a change in the tenure type of the project or activities; or a funding increase to a project or activity of $100,000 or 50% (whichever is greater). The HUD Field Office will notify the insular area if its program description, as amended, does not permit determinations to be made under § 92.61 (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(7), or (b)(8), or if the level of proposed projects or eligible activities is not within the management capability demonstrated by past performance in housing and community development programs, within 30 days of receipt. The insular area will have a reasonable period of time, agreed upon mutually, to submit the necessary supporting information to revise the proposed projects or activities in its program description. 

## § 92.64 Applicability of requirements to insular areas. {#sec-64}

(a) Insular areas are subject to the same requirements in subpart E (Program Requirements), subpart F (Project Requirements), subpart K (Program Administration), and subpart L (Performance Reviews and Sanctions) of this part as participating jurisdictions, except for the following: 

(1) Subpart E (Program Requirements): Administrative costs, as described in § 92.207, are eligible costs for insular areas in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the HOME funds provided to the insular area. The matching contribution requirements in this part do not apply. 

(2) Subpart K (Program Administration): 

(i) Section 92.500 (The HOME Investment Trust Fund) does not apply. HUD will establish a HOME account in the United States Treasury for each insular area and the HOME funds must be used for approved activities. A local account must be established for program income. Each insular area may use either a separate local HOME account or a subsidiary account within its general fund (or other appropriate fund) as the local HOME account. HUD will recapture HOME funds in the HOME Treasury account by the amount of: 

(A) Any funds that are not committed within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the insular area of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; 

(B) Any funds that are not expended within five years after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the insular area of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; and 

(C) Any penalties assessed by HUD under § 92.552. 

(ii) Section 92.502 (Program disbursement and information system) applies, except that references to the HOME Investment Trust Fund mean HOME account. In addition, § 92.502(c) does not apply, and instead compliance with Treasury Circular No. 1075 (31 CFR part 205) and 2 CFR 200.305 is required. 

(iii) Section 92.503 (Program income, repayments, and recaptured funds) applies, except that the funds may be retained provided the funds are used for eligible activities in accordance with the requirements of this section. 

(3) Section 92.504 (Participating jurisdiction responsibilities; written agreements; on-site inspections) applies, except that the written agreement must ensure compliance with the requirements in this section. 

(4) Section 92.508 (Recordkeeping) applies with respect to the records that relate to the requirements of this section. 

(5) Section 92.509 (Performance reports) applies, except that a performance report is required for the fiscal year allocation only after completion of the approved projects funded by the allocation. 

(6) Subpart L (Performance Reviews and Sanctions): Section 92.552 does not apply. Instead, § 92.65 applies. 

(b) The requirements of subpart H (Other Federal Requirements) of this part apply as follows: § 92.357 Executive Order 12372 applies as written, and the requirements of the remaining sections which apply to participating jurisdictions are applicable to the insular areas. 

(c) Subpart B (Allocation Formula), subpart C (Consortia; Designation and Revocation as a Participating Jurisdiction), subpart D (Submission Requirements), and subpart G (Community Housing Development Organizations) of this part do not apply. 

(d) Subpart A (General) applies, except that for the definitions of commitment, program income, and subrecipient, “participating jurisdiction” means “insular area.” 

## § 92.65 Funding sanctions.

Following notice and opportunity for informal consultation, HUD may withhold, reduce or terminate the assistance where any corrective or remedial actions taken under § 92.551 fail to remedy an insular area's performance deficiencies, and the deficiencies are sufficiently substantial, in the judgment of HUD, to warrant sanctions. 

## § 92.66 Reallocation.

Any HOME funds which are reduced or recaptured from an insular area's allocation and which are not used to increase the allocation amount for one or more of the remaining insular areas as provided in § 92.60 of this part, will be reallocated by HUD to the States in accordance with the requirements in subpart J for reallocating funds initially allocated to a State.

# Subpart C—Consortia; Designation and Revocation of Designation as a Participating Jurisdiction {#subpart-C}

## § 92.100 [Reserved]

## § 92.101 Consortia.

(a) A consortium of geographically contiguous units of general local government is a unit of general local government for purposes of this part if the requirements of this section are met. 

(1) One or more members of a proposed consortium or an existing consortium whose consortium qualification terminates at the end of the fiscal year, must provide written notification to the HUD Field Office of its intent to participate as a consortium in the HOME Program for the following fiscal year. HUD shall establish the deadline for this submission. 

(2) The proposed consortium must provide, at such time and in a manner and form prescribed by HUD, the qualification documents, which will include submission of: 

(i) A written certification by the State that the consortium will direct its activities to alleviation of housing problems within the State; and 

(ii) Documentation which demonstrates that the consortium has executed one legally binding cooperation agreement among its members authorizing one member unit of general local government to act in a representative capacity for all member units of general local government for the purposes of this part and providing that the representative member assumes overall responsibility for ensuring that the consortium's HOME Program is carried out in compliance with the requirements of this part. 

(3) Before the end of the fiscal year in which the notice of intent and documentation are submitted, HUD must determine that a proposed consortium has sufficient authority and administrative capability to carry out the purposes of this part on behalf of its member jurisdictions. HUD will endeavor to make its determination as quickly as practicable after receiving the consortium's documentation in order to provide the consortium an opportunity to correct its submission, if necessary. If the submission is deficient, HUD will work with the consortium to resolve the issue, but will not delay the formula allocations. HUD, at its discretion, may review the performance of an existing consortium that wishes to requalify to determine whether it continues to have sufficient authority and administrative capacity to successfully administer the program. 

(b) A metropolitan city or an urban county may be a member of a consortium. A unit of general local government that is included in an urban county may be part of a consortium, only if the urban county joins the consortium. The included local government cannot join the consortium except through participation in the urban county. 

(c) A non-urban county may be a member of a consortium. However, the county cannot on its own include the whole county in the consortium. A unit of local government located within the non-urban county that wishes to participate as a member of the consortium must sign the HOME consortium agreement. 

(d) If the representative unit of general local government distributes HOME funds to member units of general local government, the representative unit is responsible for applying to the member units of general local government the same requirements as are applicable to subrecipients. 

(e) The consortium's qualification as a unit of general local government continues for a period of three successive Federal fiscal years, or until HUD revokes its designation as a participating jurisdiction, or until an urban county member fails to requalify under the CDBG program as an urban county for a fiscal year included in the consortium's qualification period, or the consortium fails to receive a HOME allocation for the first Federal fiscal year of the consortium's qualification period and does not request to be considered to receive a HOME allocation in each of the subsequent two years. However, if a member urban county's three year CDBG qualification cycle is not the same as the consortium, the consortium may elect a shorter qualification period than three years to synchronize with the urban county's qualification period. During the period of qualification, additional units of general local government may join the consortium, but no included unit of general local government may withdraw from the consortium. See 24 CFR part 91, subpart E, for consolidated plan requirements for consortia, including the requirement that all members of the consortia must be on the same program year. 

(f) The consortium agreement may, at the option of its member units of general local government, contain a provision that authorizes automatic renewals for the successive qualification period of three Federal fiscal years. The provision authorizing automatic renewal must require the lead consortium member to give the consortium members written notice of their right to elect not to continue participation for the new qualification period. 

## § 92.102 Participation threshold amount.

(a) To be eligible to become a participating jurisdiction, a unit of general local government must have a formula allocation under § 92.50 that is equal to or greater than $750,000; or 

(b) If a unit of general local government's formula allocation is less than $750,000, HUD must find: 

(1) The unit of general local government has a local PHA and has demonstrated a capacity to carry out the provisions of this part, as evidenced by satisfactory performance under one or more HUD-administered programs that provide assistance for activities comparable to the eligible activities under this part; and 

(2) The State has authorized HUD to transfer to the unit of general local government a portion of the State's allocation or the State, the unit of general local government, or both, has made available its own resources such that the sum of the amounts transferred or made available are equal to or greater than the difference between the unit of general local government's formula allocation and $750,000. 

(c) In fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than \$1.5 billion for this part, \$500,000 is substituted for \$750,000 each time it appears in this section. 

## § 92.103 Notification of intent to participate.

(a) Not later than 30 days after receiving notice of its formula allocation amount, a jurisdiction must notify HUD in writing of its intention to become a participating jurisdiction. 

(b) A unit of general local government that has a formula allocation of less than \$750,000, or less than \$500,000 in fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than $1.5 billion for this part, must submit, with its notice, one or more of the following, as appropriate, as evidence that it has met the threshold allocation requirements in § 92.102(b): 

(1) Authorization from the State to transfer a portion of its allocation to the unit of general local government; 

(2) A letter from the governor or designee indicating that the required funds have been approved and budgeted for the unit of general local government; 

(3) A letter from the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government indicating that the required funds have been approved and budgeted. 

## § 92.104 Submission of a consolidated plan.

A jurisdiction that has not submitted a consolidated plan to HUD must submit to HUD, not later than 90 calendar days after providing notification under § 92.103, a consolidated plan in accordance with 24 CFR part 91. 

## § 92.105 Designation as a participating jurisdiction.

When a jurisdiction has complied with the requirements of §§ 92.102 through 92.104 and HUD has approved the jurisdiction's consolidated plan in accordance with 24 CFR part 91, HUD will designate the jurisdiction as a participating jurisdiction. 

## § 92.106 Continuous designation as a participating jurisdiction.

Once a State or unit of general local government is designated a participating jurisdiction, it remains a participating jurisdiction for subsequent fiscal years and the requirements of §§ 92.102 through 92.105 do not apply, unless HUD revokes the designation in accordance with § 92.107. 

## § 92.107 Revocation of designation as a participating jurisdiction.

HUD may revoke a jurisdiction's designation as a participating jurisdiction if: 

(a) HUD finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing as provided in § 92.552(b) that the jurisdiction is unwilling or unable to carry out the provisions of this part, including failure to meet matching contribution requirements; or 

(b) The jurisdiction's formula allocation falls below \$750,000 (or below \$500,000 in fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than \$1.5 billion for this part) for three consecutive years, below \$625,000 (or below \$410,000 in fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than \$1.5 billion for this part) for two consecutive years, or the jurisdiction does not receive a formula allocation in any one year. 

(c) When HUD revokes a participating jurisdiction's designation as a participating jurisdiction, HUD will reallocate any remaining funds in the jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund established under § 92.500 in accordance with § 92.451.

# Subpart D—Submission Requirements

## § 92.150 Submission requirements. {#sec-150}

In order to receive its HOME allocation, a participating jurisdiction must submit a consolidated plan in accordance with 24 CFR part 91. That part includes requirements for the content of the consolidated plan, the process of developing the consolidated plan, including citizen participation, the submission date, HUD approval, and amendments. 

# Subpart E—Program Requirements

## § 92.200 Private-public partnership. {#sec-200}

Each participating jurisdiction must make all reasonable efforts to maximize participation by the private sector in accordance with section 221 of the Act. 

## § 92.201 Distribution of assistance. {#sec-201}

### (a) Local. 

(1) [](){#sec-201-a-1} Each local participating jurisdiction must, insofar as is feasible, distribute HOME funds geographically within its boundaries and among different categories of housing need, according to the priorities of housing need identified in its approved consolidated plan. 

(2) [](){#sec-201-a-2} The participating jurisdiction may only invest its HOME funds in eligible projects within its boundaries, or in jointly funded projects within the boundaries of contiguous local jurisdictions which serve residents from both jurisdictions. For a project to be jointly funded, both jurisdictions must make a financial contribution to the project. A jurisdiction's financial contribution may take the form of a grant or loan (including a loan of funds that comes from other federal sources and that are in the jurisdiction's control, such as CDBG program funds) or relief of a significant tax or fee (such as waiver of impact fees, property taxes, or other taxes or fees customarily imposed on projects within the jurisdiction). 

### (b) State. 

(1) [](){#sec-201-b-1} Each State participating jurisdiction is responsible for distributing HOME funds throughout the State according to the State's assessment of the geographical distribution of the housing needs within the State, as identified in the State's approved consolidated plan. The State must distribute HOME funds to rural areas in amounts that take into account the non-metropolitan share of the State's total population and objective measures of rural housing need, such as poverty and substandard housing, as set forth in the State's approved consolidated plan. To the extent the need is within the boundaries of a participating unit of general local government, the State and the unit of general local government shall coordinate activities to address that need. 

(2) [](){#sec-201-b-2} A State may carry out its own HOME program without active participation of units of general local government or may distribute HOME funds to units of general local government to carry out HOME programs in which both the State and all or some of the units of general local government perform specified program functions. A unit of general local government designated by a State to receive HOME funds from a State is a State recipient. 

(3) [](){#sec-201-b-3} 

    (i) [](){#sec-201-b-3-i} A State that uses State recipients to perform program functions shall ensure that the State recipients use HOME funds in accordance with the requirements of this part and other applicable laws. The State may require the State recipient to comply with requirements established by the State or may permit the State recipient to establish its own requirements to comply with this part. 

    (ii) [](){#sec-201-b-3-ii} The State shall conduct such reviews and audit of its State recipients as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether the State recipient has committed and expended the HOME funds in the United States Treasury account as required by [§ 92.500](#sec-500), and has met the requirements of this part, particularly eligible activities, income targeting, affordability, and matching contribution requirements. 

(4) [](){#sec-201-b-4} A State and local participating jurisdiction may jointly fund a project within the boundaries of the local participating jurisdiction. The State may provide the HOME funds to the project or it may provide the HOME funds to the local participating jurisdiction to fund the project. 

(5) [](){#sec-201-b-5} A State may fund projects on Indian reservations located within the State provided that the State includes Indian reservations in its consolidated plan. 

## § 92.202 Site and neighborhood standards. {#sec-202}

### (a) General. {#sec-202-a}

A participating jurisdiction must administer its HOME program in a manner that provides housing that is suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d—2000d–4), the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., E.O. 11063 (3 CFR, 1959–1963 Comp., p. 652), and HUD regulations issued pursuant thereto; and promotes greater choice of housing opportunities. 

### (b) New rental housing. {#sec-202-b}

In carrying out the site and neighborhood requirements with respect to new construction of rental housing, a participating jurisdiction is responsible for making the determination that proposed sites for new construction meet the requirements in 24 CFR 983.57(e)(2) and (3).

## § 92.203 Income determinations. {#sec-203}

(a) [](){#sec-203-a} The HOME program has income targeting requirements for the HOME program and for HOME projects. Therefore, the participating jurisdiction must determine each family is income eligible by determining the family's annual income.

    (1) [](){#sec-203-a-1} For families who are tenants in HOME-assisted housing and not receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance, the participating jurisdiction must initially determine annual income using the method in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. For subsequent income determinations during the period of affordability, the participating jurisdiction may use any one of the following methods in accordance with [§ 92.252(h)](#sec-252-h):

        (i) [](){#sec-203-a-1-i} Examine at least 2 months of source documents evidencing annual income (e.g., wage statement, interest statement, unemployment compensation statement) for the family. 
    
        (ii) [](){#sec-203-a-1-ii} Obtain from the family a written statement of the amount of the family's annual income and family size, along with a certification that the information is complete and accurate. The certification must state that the family will provide source documents upon request. 
    
        (iii) [](){#sec-203-a-1-iii} Obtain a written statement from the administrator of a government program under which the family receives benefits and which examines each year the annual income of the family. The statement must indicate the tenant's family size and state the amount of the family's annual income; or alternatively, the statement must indicate the current dollar limit for very low- or low-income families for the family size of the tenant and state that the tenant's annual income does not exceed this limit.
        
(2) [](){#sec-203-a-2} For all other families (i.e., homeowners receiving rehabilitation assistance, homebuyers, and recipients of HOME tenant-based rental assistance), the participating jurisdiction must determine annual income by examining at least 2 months of source documents evidencing annual income (e.g., wage statement, interest statement, unemployment compensation statement) for the family.

(b) [](){#sec-203-b} When determining whether a family is income eligible, the participating jurisdiction must use one of the following two definitions of “annual income”: 

    (1) [](){#sec-203-b-1} Annual income as defined at [24 CFR 5.609](5.qmd#sec-609) (except when determining the income of a homeowner for an owner-occupied rehabilitation project, the value of the homeowner's principal residence may be excluded from the calculation of Net Family Assets, as defined in [24 CFR 5.603](5.qmd#sec-603)); or 

    (2) [](){#sec-203-b-2} Adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting under Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 series for individual Federal annual income tax purposes. 

(c) [](){#sec-203-c} Although the participating jurisdiction may use either of the definitions of “annual income” permitted in paragraph (b) of this section to calculate adjusted income, it must apply exclusions from income established at [24 CFR 5.611](5.qmd#sec-611). The HOME rents for very low-income families established under [§ 92.252(b)(2)](#sec-252-b-2) are based on adjusted income. In addition, the participating jurisdiction may base the amount of tenant-based rental assistance on the adjusted income of the family. The participating jurisdiction may use only one definition for each HOME-assisted program (e.g., downpayment assistance program) that it administers and for each rental housing project. 

(d) [](){#sec-203-d} 

    (1) [](){#sec-203-d-1} The participating jurisdiction must calculate the annual income of the family by projecting the prevailing rate of income of the family at the time the participating jurisdiction determines that the family is income eligible. Annual income shall include income from all persons in the household. Income or asset enhancement derived from the HOME-assisted project shall not be considered in calculating annual income. 

    (2) [](){#sec-203-d-2} The participating jurisdiction is not required to re-examine the family's income at the time the HOME assistance is provided, unless more than six months has elapsed since the participating jurisdiction determined that the family qualified as income eligible. 

    (3) [](){#sec-203-d-3} The participating jurisdiction must follow the requirements in [§ 5.617](5.qmd#sec-617) when making subsequent income determinations of persons with disabilities who are tenants in HOME-assisted rental housing or who receive tenant-based rental assistance.

§ 92.204 Applicability of requirements to entities that receive a reallocation of HOME funds, other than participating jurisdictions.

(a) Jurisdictions other than participating jurisdictions and community housing development organizations receiving competitive reallocations from HUD are subject to the same requirements in subpart E (Program Requirements), subpart F (Project Requirements), subpart K (Program Administration), and subpart L (Performance Reviews and Sanctions) of this part as participating jurisdictions, except for the following: 

(1) Subpart E (Program Requirements): the matching contribution requirements in § 92.218 through § 92.221 do not apply. 

(2) Subpart K (Program Administration): 

(i) Section 92.500 (The HOME Investment Trust Fund) does not apply. HUD will establish a HOME account in the United States Treasury and the HOME funds must be used for approved activities. A local account must be established for program income. HUD will recapture HOME funds in the HOME Treasury account by the amount of: 

(A) Any funds that are not committed within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the entity of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; 

(B) Any funds that are not expended within five years after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the entity of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; and

## § 92.205 Eligible activities: General. {#sec-205}

### (a) Eligible activities. {#sec-205-a}

(1) [](){#sec-205-a-1} HOME funds may be used by a participating jurisdiction to provide incentives to develop and support affordable rental housing and homeownership affordability through the acquisition (including assistance to homebuyers), new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of nonluxury housing with suitable amenities, including real property acquisition, site improvements, conversion, demolition, and other expenses, including financing costs, relocation expenses of any displaced persons, families, businesses, or organizations; to provide tenant-based rental assistance, including security deposits; to provide payment of reasonable administrative and planning costs; and to provide for the payment of operating expenses of community housing development organizations. The housing must be permanent or transitional housing. The specific eligible costs for these activities are set forth in §§ [92.206](#sec-206) through [92.209](#sec-209). The activities and costs are eligible only if the housing meets the property standards in [§ 92.251](#sec-251) upon project completion. 

(2) [](){#sec-205-a-2} Acquisition of vacant land or demolition must be undertaken only with respect to a particular housing project intended to provide affordable housing within the time frames established in paragraph (2) of the definition of “[commitment](#def-commitment)” in § 92.2.

(3) [](){#sec-205-a-3} Conversion of an existing structure to affordable housing is rehabilitation, unless the conversion entails adding one or more units beyond the existing walls, in which case, the project is new construction for purposes of this part.

(4) [](){#sec-205-a-4} Manufactured housing.  HOME funds may be used to purchase and/or rehabilitate a manufactured housing unit, or purchase the land upon which a manufactured housing unit is located. Except for existing, owner-occupied manufactured housing that is rehabilitated with HOME funds, the manufactured housing unit must, at the time of project completion, be connected to permanent utility hook-ups and be located on land that is owned by the manufactured housing unit owner or land for which the manufactured housing owner has a lease for a period at least equal to the applicable period of affordability.

### (b) Forms of assistance. {#sec-205-b}

(1) [](){#sec-205-b-1} A participating jurisdiction may invest HOME funds as equity investments, interest-bearing loans or advances, non-interest-bearing loans or advances, interest subsidies consistent with the purposes of this part, deferred payment loans, grants, or other forms of assistance that HUD determines to be consistent with the purposes of this part and specifically approves in writing. Each participating jurisdiction has the right to establish the terms of assistance, subject to the requirements of this part. 

(2) [](){#sec-205-b-2} A participating jurisdiction may invest HOME funds to guarantee loans made by lenders and, if required, the participating jurisdiction may establish a loan guarantee account with HOME funds. The HOME funds may be used to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest or payment of the outstanding principal and interest upon foreclosure of the loan. The amount of the loan guarantee account must be based on a reasonable estimate of the default rate on the guaranteed loans, but under no circumstances may the amount on deposit exceed 20 percent of the total outstanding principal amount guaranteed; except that the account may include a reasonable minimum balance. While loan funds guaranteed with HOME funds are subject to all HOME requirements, funds which are used to repay the guaranteed loans are not.

### (c) Minimum amount of assistance. {#sec-205-c}

The minimum amount of HOME funds that must be invested in a project involving rental housing or homeownership is $1,000 times the number of HOME-assisted units in the project. 

### (d) Multi-unit projects. {#sec-205-d}

HOME funds may be used to assist one or more housing units in a multi-unit project. 

(1) [](){#sec-205-d-1} Only the actual HOME eligible development costs of the assisted units may be charged to the HOME program. If the assisted and nonassisted units are not comparable, the actual costs may be determined based on a method of cost allocation. If the assisted and non- assisted units are comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms, the actual cost of the HOME- assisted units can be determined by prorating the total HOME eligible development costs of the project so that the proportion of the total development costs charged to the HOME program does not exceed the proportion of the HOME-assisted units in the project. 

(2) [](){#sec-205-d-2} After project completion, the number of units designated as HOME- assisted may be reduced only in accordance with [§ 92.210](#sec-210), except that in a project consisting of all HOME- assisted units, one unit may be subsequently converted to an on-site manager's unit if the participating jurisdiction determines that the conversion will contribute to the stability or effectiveness of the housing and that, notwithstanding the loss of one HOME-assisted unit, the costs charged to the HOME program do not exceed the actual costs of the HOME- assisted units and do not exceed the subsidy limit in [§ 92.250(b)](){#sec-250-b}. 

### (e) Terminated projects. {#sec-205-e}

A HOME assisted project that is terminated before completion, either voluntarily or involuntarily, constitutes an ineligible activity, and the participating jurisdiction must repay any HOME funds invested in the project to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund in accordance with [§ 92.503(b)](#sec-503-b) (except for project- specific assistance to community housing development organizations as provided in [§ 92.301(a)(3)](#sec-301-a-3) and [(b)(3)](#sec-301-b-3)). 

(1) [](){#sec-205-e-1} A project that does not meet the requirements for affordable housing must be terminated and the participating jurisdiction must repay all HOME funds invested in the project to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund in accordance with [§ 92.503(b)](#sec-503-b). 

(2) [](){#sec-205-e-2} If a participating jurisdiction does not complete a project within 4 years of the date of commitment of funds, the project is considered to be terminated and the participating jurisdiction must repay all funds invested in the project to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund in accordance with [§ 92.503(b)](#sec-503-b). The participating jurisdiction may request a one-year extension of this deadline in writing, by submitting information about the status of the project, steps being taken to overcome any obstacles to completion, proof of adequate funding to complete the project, and a schedule with milestones for completion of the project for HUD's review and approval.

(5) Costs to make utility connections or to make improvements to the project site, in accordance with the provisions of § 92.206(a)(3) (ii) and (iii) are also eligible in connection with acquisition of standard housing. 

### (b) Refinancing costs. {#sec-206-b}

The cost to refinance existing debt secured by a housing project that is being rehabilitated with HOME funds. These costs include the following: 

(1) For single-family (one- to four- family) owner-occupied housing, when loaning HOME funds to rehabilitate the housing, if the refinancing is necessary to reduce the overall housing costs to the borrower and make the housing more affordable and if the rehabilitation cost is greater than the amount of debt that is refinanced. 

(2) For single family or multifamily projects, when loaning HOME funds to rehabilitate the units if refinancing is necessary to permit or continue affordability under § 92.252. The participating jurisdiction must establish refinancing guidelines and state them in its consolidated plan described in 24 CFR part 91. Regardless of the amount of HOME funds invested, the minimum affordability period shall be 15 years. The guidelines shall describe the conditions under which the participating jurisdictions will refinance existing debt. At minimum, the guidelines must: 

    (i) Demonstrate that rehabilitation is the primary eligible activity and ensure that this requirement is met by establishing a minimum level of rehabilitation per unit or a required ratio between rehabilitation and refinancing; 

    (ii) Require a review of management practices to demonstrate that disinvestment in the property has not occurred, that the long term needs of the project can be met and that the feasibility of serving the targeted population over an extended affordability period can be demonstrated; 

    (iii) State whether the new investment is being made to maintain current affordable units, create additional affordable units, or both; 

    (iv) Specify the required period of affordability, whether it is the minimum 15 years or longer; 

    (v) Specify whether the investment of HOME funds may be jurisdiction-wide or limited to a specific geographic area, such as a neighborhood identified in a neighborhood revitalization strategy under 24 CFR 91.215(e)(2) or a Federally designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community; and 

    (vi) State that HOME funds cannot be used to refinance single family or multifamily housing loans made or insured by any Federal program, including CDBG. 

### (c) Acquisition costs. {#sec-206-c}

(1) Architectural, engineering, or related professional services required to prepare plans, drawings, specifications, or work write-ups. The costs may be paid if they were incurred not more than 24 months before the date that HOME funds are committed to the project and the participating jurisdiction expressly permits HOME funds to be used to pay the costs in the written agreement committing the funds. 

(2) Costs to process and settle the financing for a project, such as private lender origination fees, credit reports, fees for title evidence, fees for recordation and filing of legal documents, building permits, attorneys fees, private appraisal fees and fees for an independent cost estimate, builders or developers fees. 

(3) Costs of a project audit, including certification of costs performed by a certified public accountant, that the participating jurisdiction may require with respect to the development of the project. 

(4) Costs to provide information services such as affirmative marketing and fair housing information to prospective homeowners and tenants as required by § 92.351. 

(5) For new construction or rehabilitation, the cost of funding an initial operating deficit reserve, which is a reserve to meet any shortfall in project income during the period of project rent-up (not to exceed 18 months) and which may only be used to pay project operating expenses, scheduled payments to a replacement reserve, and debt service. Any HOME funds placed in an operating deficit reserve that remain unexpended after the period of project rent-up may be retained for project reserves if permitted by the participating jurisdiction. 

(6) Staff and overhead costs of the participating jurisdiction directly related to carrying out the project, such as work specifications preparation, loan processing inspections, and other services related to assisting potential owners, tenants, and homebuyers, e.g., housing counseling, may be charged to project costs only if the project is funded and the individual becomes the owner or tenant of the HOME-assisted project. For multi-unit projects, such costs must be allocated among HOME- assisted units in a reasonable manner and documented. Although these costs may be charged as project costs, these costs (except housing counseling) cannot be charged to or paid by low-income families. 

(7) For both new construction and rehabilitation, costs for the payment of impact fees that are charged for all projects within a jurisdiction. 

(8) Costs of environmental review and release of funds in accordance with 24 CFR part 58 which are directly related to the project. 

### (e) Community housing development organization costs. {#sec-206-e}

Eligible costs of project-specific assistance are set forth in § 92.301. 

### (f) Relocation costs. {#sec-206-f}

The cost of relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by the project are eligible costs. 

(1) Relocation payments include replacement housing payments, payments for moving expenses, and payments for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in the temporary relocation of persons. 

(2) Other relocation assistance means staff and overhead costs directly related to providing advisory and other relocation services to persons displaced by the project, including timely written notices to occupants, referrals to comparable and suitable replacement property, property inspections, counseling, and other assistance necessary to minimize hardship. 

### (g) Costs relating to payment of loans. {#sec-206-g}

If the HOME funds are not used to directly pay a cost specified in this section, but are used to pay off a construction loan, bridge financing loan, or guaranteed loan, the payment of principal and interest for such loan is an eligible cost only if: 

(1) The loan was used for eligible costs specified in this section, and 

(2) The HOME assistance is part of the original financing for the project and the project meets the requirements of this part.

## § 92.207 Eligible administrative and planning costs. {#sec-207}

A participating jurisdiction may expend, for payment of reasonable administrative and planning costs of the HOME program and ADDI, an amount of HOME funds that is not more than ten percent of the sum of the Fiscal Year HOME basic formula allocation plus any funds received in accordance with § 92.102(b) to meet or exceed participation threshold requirements that Fiscal Year. A state that transfers any HOME funds in accordance with § 92.102(b) must exclude these funds in calculating the amount it may expend for administrative and planning costs. A participating jurisdiction may also expend, for payment of reasonable administrative and planning costs of the HOME program and the ADDI described in subpart M of this part, a sum up to ten percent of the program income deposited into its local account or received and reported by its state recipients or subrecipients during the program year. A participating jurisdiction may expend such funds directly or may authorize its state recipients or subrecipients, if any, to expend all or a portion of such funds, provided total expenditures for planning and administrative costs do not exceed the maximum allowable amount. Reasonable administrative and planning costs include:

The participating jurisdiction may use only one of these methods. Program administration includes the following types of assignments: 

(i) Developing systems and schedules for ensuring compliance with program requirements; 

(ii) Developing interagency agreements and agreements with entities receiving HOME funds; 

(iii) Monitoring HOME-assisted housing for progress and compliance with program requirements;

These costs may be charged as administrative costs or as project costs under § 92.206(d)(6) and (f)(2), at the discretion of the participating jurisdiction; however, these costs (except housing counseling) cannot be charged to or paid by the low-income families. 

### (c) Public information. {#sec-207-c}

The provision of information and other resources to residents and citizen organizations participating in the planning, implementation, or assessment of projects being assisted with HOME funds.

## § 92.208 Eligible community housing development organization (CHDO) operating expense and capacity building costs. {#sec-208}

(a) Up to 5 percent of a participating jurisdiction's fiscal year HOME allocation may be used for the operating expenses of community housing development organizations (CHDOs). This amount is in addition to amounts set aside for housing projects that are owned, developed, or sponsored by CHDOs as described in § 92.300(a). These funds may not be used to pay operating expenses incurred by a CHDO acting as a subrecipient or contractor under the HOME Program. Operating expenses means reasonable and necessary costs for the operation of the community housing development organization. Such costs include salaries, wages, and other employee compensation and benefits; employee education, training, and travel; rent; utilities; communication costs; taxes; insurance; equipment; materials; and supplies. The requirements and limitations on the receipt of these funds by CHDOs are set forth in § 92.300(e) and (f).

## § 92.209 Tenant-based rental assistance: Eligible costs and requirements. {#sec-209}

### (a) Eligible costs. {#sec-209-a}

Eligible costs are the rental assistance and security deposit payments made to provide tenant-based rental assistance for a family pursuant to this section. Eligible costs also include utility deposit assistance, but only if this assistance is provided with tenant-based rental assistance or security deposit payment. Administration of tenant-based rental assistance is eligible only under general management oversight and coordination at § 92.207(a), except that the costs of inspecting the housing and determining the income eligibility of the family are eligible as costs of the tenant-based rental assistance. 

### (b) General requirement. {#sec-209-b}

A participating jurisdiction may use HOME funds for tenant-based rental assistance only if the participating jurisdiction makes the certification about inclusion of this type of assistance in its consolidated plan in accordance with 24 CFR 91.225(d)(1), 91.325(d)(1), or 91.425(a)(2)(i), and specifies local market conditions that lead to the choice of this option. 

### (c) Tenant selection. {#sec-209-c}

The participating jurisdiction must select low-income families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria that are based on local housing needs and priorities established in the participating jurisdiction's consolidated plan. 

#### (1) Low-income families. {#sec-209-c-1}

Tenant-based rental assistance may only be provided to very low- and low-income families. The participating jurisdiction must determine that the family is very low- or low-income before the assistance is provided. During the period of assistance, the participating jurisdiction must annually determine that the family continues to be low-income. 

#### (2) Targeted assistance. {#sec-209-c-2}

(i) The participating jurisdiction may establish a preference for individuals with special needs (e.g., homeless persons or elderly persons) or persons with disabilities. The participating jurisdiction may offer, in conjunction with a tenant-based rental assistance program, particular types of nonmandatory services that may be most appropriate for persons with a special need or a particular disability. Generally, tenant-based rental assistance and the related services should be made available to all persons with special needs or disabilities who can benefit from such services. Participation may be limited to persons with a specific disability if necessary to provide as effective housing, aid, benefit, or services as those provided to others in accordance with 24 CFR 8.4(b)(1)(iv). 

(ii) The participating jurisdiction may also provide a preference for a specific category of individuals with disabilities (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or chronic mental illness) if the specific category is identified in the participating jurisdiction's consolidated plan as having unmet need and the preference is needed to narrow the gap in benefits and services received by such persons. 

(iii) Self-sufficiency program.  The participating jurisdiction may require the family to participate in a self- sufficiency program as a condition of selection for assistance. The family's failure to continue participation in the self-sufficiency program is not a basis for terminating the assistance; however, renewal of the assistance may be conditioned on participation in the program. Tenants living in a HOME- assisted rental project who receive tenant-based rental assistance as relocation assistance must not be required to participate in a self- sufficiency program as a condition of receiving assistance. 

(iv) Homebuyer program.  HOME tenant-based rental assistance may assist a tenant who has been identified as a potential low-income homebuyer through a lease-purchase agreement, with monthly rental payments for a period up to 36 months (i.e., 24 months, with a 12-month renewal in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section). The HOME tenant-based rental assistance payment may not be used to accumulate a downpayment or closing costs for the purchase; however, all or a portion of the homebuyer-tenant's monthly contribution toward rent may be set aside for this purpose. If a participating jurisdiction determines that the tenant has met the lease-purchase criteria and is ready to assume ownership, HOME funds may be provided for downpayment assistance in accordance with the requirements of this part. 

(v) Preferences cannot be administered in a manner that limits the opportunities of persons on any basis prohibited by the laws listed under 24 CFR 5.105(a). For example, a participating jurisdiction may not determine that persons given a preference under the program are therefore prohibited from applying for or participating in other programs or forms of assistance. Persons who are eligible for a preference must have the opportunity to participate in all programs of the participating jurisdiction, including programs that are not separate or different. 

#### (3) Existing tenants in the HOME-assisted projects.  {#sec-209-c-3}

A participating jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in housing units that are designated for rehabilitation or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program. Participating jurisdictions using HOME funds for tenant-based rental assistance programs may establish local preferences for the provision of this assistance. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitated or acquired housing unit or in other qualified housing. 

### (d) Portability of assistance. {#sec-209-d}

A participating jurisdiction may require the family to use the tenant-based assistance within the participating jurisdiction's boundaries or may permit the family to use the assistance outside its boundaries. 

### (e) Term of rental assistance contract. {#sec-209-e}

The term of the rental assistance contract providing assistance with HOME funds may not exceed 24 months, but may be renewed, subject to the availability of HOME funds. The term of the rental assistance contract must begin on the first day of the term of the lease. For a rental assistance contract between a participating jurisdiction and an owner, the term of the contract must terminate on termination of the lease. For a rental assistance contract between a participating jurisdiction and a family, the term of the contract need not end on termination of the lease, but no payments may be made after termination of the lease until a family enters into a new lease. 

### (f) Rent reasonableness. {#sec-209-f}

The participating jurisdiction must disapprove a lease if the rent is not reasonable, based on rents that are charged for comparable unassisted rental units. 

### (g) Tenant protections. {#sec-209-g}

The tenant must have a lease that complies with the requirements in § 92.253 (a) and (b). 

#### (h) Maximum subsidy. {#sec-209-h}

(1) The amount of the monthly assistance that a participating jurisdiction may pay to, or on behalf of, a family may not exceed the difference between a rent standard for the unit size established by the participating jurisdiction and 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income. 

(2) The participating jurisdiction must establish a minimum tenant contribution to rent. 

(3) The participating jurisdiction's rent standard for a unit size must be based on: 

(i) Local market conditions; or 

(ii) The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (24 CFR part 982). 

### (i) Housing standards. {#sec-209-i}

Housing occupied by a family receiving tenant-based rental assistance under this section must meet the participating jurisdiction's property standards under § 92.251. The participating jurisdiction must inspect the housing initially and re-inspect it annually. 

### (j) Security deposits. {#sec-209-j}

(1) A participating jurisdiction may use HOME funds provided for tenant-based rental assistance to provide loans or grants to very low- and low-income families for security deposits for rental of dwelling units whether or not the participating jurisdiction provides any other tenant-based rental assistance under this section. 

(2) The relevant State or local definition of “security deposit” in the jurisdiction where the unit is located is applicable for the purposes of this part, except that the amount of HOME funds that may be provided for a security deposit may not exceed the equivalent of two month's rent for the unit. 

(3) Only the prospective tenant may apply for HOME security deposit assistance, although the participating jurisdiction may pay the funds directly to the tenant or to the landlord. 

(4) HOME funds for security deposits may be provided as a grant or as a loan. If they are provided as a loan, the loan repayments are program income to be used in accordance with § 92.503. 

(5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (i) of this section are applicable to HOME security deposit assistance, except that income determinations pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section and Housing Quality Standard inspections pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section are required only at the time the security deposit assistance is provided. 

### (k) Program operation. {#sec-209-k}

A tenant-based rental assistance program must be operated consistent with the requirements of this section. The participating jurisdiction may operate the program itself, or may contract with a PHA or other entity with the capacity to operate a rental assistance program. The tenant-based rental assistance may be provided through an assistance contract to an owner that leases a unit to an assisted family or directly to the family. In either case, the participating jurisdiction (or entity operating the program) must approve the lease. 

### (l) Use of Section 8 assistance. {#sec-209-l}

In any case where assistance under section 8 of the 1937 Act becomes available, recipients of tenant-based rental assistance under this part will qualify for tenant selection preferences to the same extent as when they received the HOME tenant-based rental assistance under this part. 

## § 92.210 Troubled HOME-assisted rental housing projects. {#sec-210}

(a) The provisions of this section apply only to an existing HOME- assisted rental project that, within the HOME period of affordability, is no longer financially viable. For purposes of this section, a HOME assisted rental project is no longer financially viable if its operating costs significantly exceed its operating revenue. HUD may approve one or both of the actions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to strategically preserve a rental project after consideration of market needs, available resources, and the likelihood of long-term viability of the project. 

(b) Notwithstanding § 92.214, a participating jurisdiction may request and HUD may permit, pursuant to a written memorandum of agreement, a participating jurisdiction to invest additional HOME funds in the existing HOME-assisted rental project. The total HOME funding for the project (original investment plus additional investment) must not exceed the per-unit subsidy limit in § 92.250(a). The use of HOME funds may include, but is not limited to, rehabilitation of the HOME units and recapitalization of project reserves for the HOME units (to fund capital costs). If additional HOME funds are invested, HUD may require the period of affordability to be extended, based on such considerations as the amount of additional HOME funds or additional units. 

(c) HUD Headquarters may, through written approval, permit the participating jurisdiction to reduce the number of HOME-assisted units, if the project contains more than the minimum number of units required to be designated as HOME-assisted under § 92.205(d). In determining whether to permit a reduction in the number of HOME-assisted units, HUD will take into account the required period of affordability and the amount of HOME assistance provided to the project. 

## § 92.212 Pre-award costs. {#sec-212}

### (a) General. {#sec-212-a}

Before the effective date of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement, the participating jurisdiction may incur costs which may be charged to the HOME allocation after the award of the HOME allocation, provided the costs are in compliance with the requirements of this part (including environmental review requirements) and with the statutory and regulatory requirements in effect at the time the costs are charged to the HOME allocation. 

### (b) Administrative and planning costs. {#sec-212-b}

Eligible administrative and planning costs may be incurred as of the beginning of the participating jurisdiction's consolidated program year (see 24 CFR 91.10) or the date the consolidated plan describing the HOME allocation to which the costs will be charged is received by HUD, whichever is later. 

### (c) Project costs. {#sec-212-c}

Eligible project costs may be incurred during the current program year in an amount not to exceed 25% of the current HOME allocation amount, to be charged to the following year's HOME allocation. Before incurring the pre-award costs, the participating jurisdiction must comply with its citizen participation plan requirements addressing 24 CFR 91.105(b)(2), (4), (5) and (g) (local governments) or 24 CFR 91.115(b)(2), (4), (5) and (f) (States). In lieu of a full action plan, the participating jurisdiction may develop a mini-action plan which describes the proposed pre-award projects and costs in accordance with 24 CFR 91.220(c) and includes, if applicable, 24 CFR 91.220(g)(2) (local governments) or 24 CFR 91.320(c) and, if applicable, 24 CFR 91.320(g)(2) (States). The mini-action plan must state that HOME funding for the project(s) is subject to the future availability of HOME funds. The subsequent action plan (i.e., action plan for the HOME allocation to which the costs will be charged) must also include the use of HOME funds contained in the mini-action plan. 

### (d) Subrecipient or State recipient costs. {#sec-212-d}

The participating jurisdiction may authorize its subrecipient or State recipient to incur pre-award costs in accordance with the requirements of this section. The authorization must be in writing. 

### (e) Other pre-agreement costs. {#sec-212-e}

Pre-agreement costs in excess of the amount set forth in paragraph (c) of this section must be approved, in writing, by the HUD Field Office before the costs are incurred. 

## § 92.213 HOME Funds and Public Housing. {#sec-213}

(a) General rule.  HOME funds may not be used for public housing units. HOME-assisted housing units may not receive Operating Fund or Capital Fund assistance under section 9 of the 1937 Act during the HOME period of affordability. 

(b) Exception.  HOME funds may be used for the development of public housing units, if the units are developed under section 24 of the 1937 Act (HOPE VI) and no Capital Fund assistance under section 9(d) of the Act is used for the development of the unit. Units developed with both HOME and HOPE VI may receive operating assistance under section 9 of the 1937 Act. Units developed with HOME and HOPE VI funds under this paragraph may subsequently receive Capital Funds for rehabilitation or modernization. 

(c) Using HOME funds in public housing projects.  Consistent with § 92.205(d), HOME funds may be used for affordable housing units in a project that also contains public housing units, provided that the HOME funds are not used for the public housing units (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) and HOME funds are used only for eligible costs in accordance with this part. 

(d) The HOME funds must be used in accordance with the requirements of this part and the project must meet the requirements of this part, including rent requirements in § 92.252. 

## § 92.214 Prohibited activities and fees. {#sec-214}

(a) HOME funds may not be used to: 

    (1) [](){#sec-214-a-1} Provide project reserve accounts, except as provided in § 92.206(d)(5), or operating subsidies;

    (6) [](){#sec-214-a-6} Provide assistance (other than tenant-based rental assistance, assistance to a homebuyer to acquire housing previously assisted with HOME funds, or assistance to preserve affordability of homeownership housing in accordance with § 92.254(a)(9)) to a project previously assisted with HOME funds during the period of affordability established by the particular jurisdiction in the written agreement under § 92.504. However, additional HOME funds may be committed to a project for up to one year after project completion (see § 92.502), but the amount of HOME funds in the project may not exceed the maximum per-unit subsidy amount established under § 92.250. 

    (7) [](){#sec-214-a-7} Pay for the acquisition of property owned by the participating jurisdiction, except for property acquired by the participating jurisdiction with HOME funds, or property acquired in anticipation of carrying out a HOME project; or

(b) 

    (1) Participating jurisdictions may not charge (and must prohibit State recipients, subrecipients, and community housing development organizations from charging) servicing, origination, or other fees for the purpose of covering costs of administering the HOME program (e.g., fees on low-income families for construction management or for inspections for compliance with property standards) (see § 92.206(d)(6) and § 92.207), except that: 

        (i) Participating jurisdictions and State recipients may charge owners of rental projects reasonable annual fees for compliance monitoring during the period of affordability. The fees must be based upon the average actual cost of performing the monitoring of HOME-assisted rental projects. The basis for determining the amount of for the fee amount must be documented and the fee must be included in the costs of the project as part of the project underwriting; 

        (ii) Participating jurisdictions, subrecipients and State recipients may charge nominal application fees (although these fees are not an eligible HOME cost) to project owners to discourage frivolous applications. The amount of application fees must be appropriate to the type of application and may not create an undue impediment to a low-income family's, subrecipient's, State recipient's, or other entity's participation in the participating jurisdiction's program; and 

        (iii) Participating jurisdictions, subrecipients and State recipients may charge homebuyers a fee for housing counseling. 

    (2) All fees charged under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are applicable credits under 2 CFR 200.406.

        (i) Reasonable application fees to prospective tenants; 

        (ii) Parking fees to tenants only if such fees are customary for rental housing projects in the neighborhood; and 

        (iii) Fees for services such as bus transportation or meals, as long as the services are voluntary and fees are charged for services provided. 

## § 92.215 Limitation on jurisdictions under court order. {#sec-215}

Limitations on the use of HOME funds in connection with litigation involving discrimination or fair housing are set forth in section 224 of the Act. 

Income Targeting 

## § 92.216 Income targeting: Tenant-based rental assistance and rental units. {#sec-216}

Each participating jurisdiction must invest HOME funds made available during a fiscal year so that, with respect to tenant-based rental assistance and rental units: 

(a) Not less than 90 percent of: 

(1) The families receiving such rental assistance are families whose annual incomes do not exceed 60 percent of the median family income for the area, as determined and made available by HUD with adjustments for smaller and larger families (except that HUD may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 60 percent of the median for the area on the basis of HUD's findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction cost or fair market rent, or unusually high or low family income) at the time of occupancy or at the time funds are invested, whichever is later; or 

(2) The dwelling units assisted with such funds are occupied by families having such incomes; and 

(b) The remainder of: 

(1) The families receiving such rental assistance are households that qualify as low-income families (other than families described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) at the time of occupancy or at the time funds are invested, whichever is later; or

(2) The dwelling units assisted with such funds are occupied by such households. 

## § 92.217 Income targeting: Homeownership.

Each participating jurisdiction must invest HOME funds made available during a fiscal year so that with respect to homeownership assistance, 100 percent of these funds are invested in dwelling units that are occupied by households that qualify as low-income families. 


Matching Contribution Requirement

## § 92.218 Amount of matching contribution.

(a) General. {#sec-218-a}

Each participating jurisdiction must make contributions to housing that qualifies as affordable housing under the HOME program, throughout a fiscal year. The contributions must total not less than 25 percent of the funds drawn from the jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund Treasury account in that fiscal year, excluding funds drawn for purposes identified in paragraph (c) of this section. 

(b) Shortfall amount from State or local resources. {#sec-218-b}

Amounts made available under § 92.102(b)(2) from the resources of a State (other than a transfer of the State's formula allocation), the local participating jurisdiction, or both, to enable the local participating jurisdiction to meet the participation threshold amount are not required to be matched and do not constitute matching contributions.

HOME funds used for administrative and planning costs (pursuant to § 92.207); community housing development organization operating expenses (pursuant to § 92.208); capacity building (pursuant to § 92.300(b)) of community housing development organizations; and project specific assistance to community housing development organizations (pursuant to § 92.301) when the participating jurisdiction waives repayment under the provisions of § 92.301(a)(3) or § 92.301(b)(3) are not required to be matched. 

(d) Match contribution for other programs. {#sec-218-d}

Contributions that have been or will be counted as satisfying a matching requirement of another Federal grant or award may not count as satisfying the matching contribution requirement for the HOME program. 

## § 92.219 Recognition of matching contribution. {#sec-219}

(a) Match contribution to HOME-assisted housing.  A contribution is recognized as a matching contribution if it is made with respect to: 

(1) A tenant who is assisted with HOME funds; 

(2) A HOME-assisted unit; 

(3) The portion of a project that is not HOME-assisted provided that at least 50 percent of the housing units in the project are HOME-assisted. If the match contribution to the portion of the project that is not HOME-assisted meets the affordable housing requirements of § 92.219(b)(2), the percentage requirement for HOME-assisted units does not apply; or 

(4) The commercial space in a mixed-use project in which at least 51 percent of the floor space is residential provided that at least 50 percent of the dwelling units are HOME-assisted. 

(b) Match contribution to affordable housing that is not HOME-assisted.  The following requirements apply for recognition of matching contributions made to affordable housing that is not HOME-assisted: 

(1) For tenant-based rental assistance that is not HOME-assisted: 

(i) The contribution must be made with respect to a tenant who is assisted with tenant-based rental assistance that meets the requirements of § 92.203 (Income determinations) and paragraphs (a), (c), (f), and (i) of § 92.209 (Tenant-based rental assistance); and 

(ii) The participating jurisdiction must demonstrate in writing that such assistance meets the provisions of §§ 92.203 and 92.209 (except § 92.209(e)). 

(2) For affordable housing that is not HOME-assisted: 

(i) The contribution must be made with respect to housing that qualifies as affordable housing under § 92.252 or § 92.254. 

(ii) The participating jurisdiction or its instrumentality must execute, with the owner of the housing (or, if the participating jurisdiction is the owner, with the manager or developer), a written agreement that imposes and enumerates all of the affordability requirements from § 92.252 and § 92.253(a) and (b) (Tenant protections), or § 92.254, whichever are applicable; the property standards requirements of § 92.251; and income determinations made in accordance with § 92.203. This written agreement must be executed before any match contributions may be made. 

(iii) A participating jurisdiction must establish a procedure to monitor HOME match-eligible housing to ensure continued compliance with the requirements of §§ 92.203 (Income determinations), 92.252 (Qualification as affordable housing: Rental housing), 92.253(a) and (b) (Tenant protections) and 92.254 (Qualification as affordable housing: Homeownership). No other HOME requirements apply. 

(iv) The match may be in any eligible form of match except those in § 92.220(a)(2) (forbearance of fees), (a)(4) (on-site and off-site infrastructure), (a)(10) (direct cost of supportive services) and (a)(11) (direct costs of homebuyer counseling services). 

(v) Match contributions to mixed-use or mixed-income projects that contain affordable housing units will be recognized only if the contribution is made to the project's affordable housing units. 

[61 FR 48750, Sept. 16, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 28929, May 28, 1997]

## § 92.220 Form of matching contribution. {#sec-220}

(a) Eligible forms.  Matching contributions must be made from nonfederal resources and may be in the form of one or more of the following: 

(1) Cash contributions from nonfederal sources.  To be recognized as a cash contribution, funds must be contributed permanently to the HOME program (or to affordable housing not assisted with HOME funds), regardless of the form of investment provided to the project. Therefore, to receive match credit for the full amount of a loan to a HOME project, all repayment, interest, or other return on investment of the contribution must be deposited in the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to be used for eligible HOME activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. A cash contribution to affordable housing that is not assisted with HOME funds must be contributed permanently to the project. Repayments of matching contributions in affordable housing projects, as defined in § 92.219(b), that are not HOME-assisted, must be made to the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to get match credit for the full loan amount. 

(i) A cash contribution may be made by the participating jurisdiction, non-Federal public entities, private entities, or individuals, except as prohibited under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. A cash contribution made to a nonprofit organization for use in a HOME project may be counted as a matching contribution. 

(ii) A cash contribution may be made from program income (as defined by 2 CFR 200.80) from a Federal grant earned after the end of the award period if no Federal requirements govern the disposition of the program income. Included in this category are repayments from closed out grants under the Urban Development Action Grant Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart G) and the Housing Development Grant Program (24 CFR part 850), and from the Rental Rehabilitation Grant Program (24 CFR part 511) after all fiscal year Rental Rehabilitation grants have been closed out. 

(iii) The grant equivalent of a below-market interest rate loan to the project that is not repayable to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund may be counted as a cash contribution, as follows: 

(A) If the loan is made from funds borrowed by a jurisdiction or public agency or corporation the contribution is the present discounted cash value of the difference between the payments to be made on the borrowed funds and payments to be received from the loan to the project based on a discount rate equal to the interest rate on the borrowed funds. 

(B) If the loan is made from funds other than funds borrowed by a jurisdiction or public agency or corporation, the contribution is the present discounted cash value of the yield foregone. In determining the yield foregone, the participating jurisdiction must use as a measure of a market rate yield one of the following, as appropriate: 

(1) With respect to one- to four-unit housing financed with a fixed interest rate mortgage, a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 200 basis points; 

(2) With respect to one- to four-unit housing financed with an adjustable interest rate mortgage, a rate equal to the one-year Treasury bill rate plus 250 basis points; 

(3) With respect to a multifamily project, a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 300 basis points; or 

(4) With respect to housing receiving financing for rehabilitation, a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 400 basis points. 

(iv) Proceeds of bonds that are not repaid with revenue from an affordable housing project (e.g., general obligation bonds) and that are loaned to a HOME-assisted or other qualified affordable housing project constitute a cash contribution under this paragraph. 

(v) A cash contribution may be counted as a matching contribution only if it is used for costs eligible under §§ 92.206 or 92.209, or for the following (which are not HOME eligible costs): the cost of removing and relocating an ECHO housing unit during the period of affordability in accordance with § 92.258(d)(3)(ii), payments to a project reserve account beyond payments permitted by § 92.206(d)(5), operating subsidies, or costs relating to the portion of a mixed-income or mixed-use HOME-assisted project not related to the affordable housing units. 

(2) Forbearance of fees —

(i) State and local taxes, charges or fees.  The value (based on customary and reasonable means for establishing value) of State or local taxes, fees, or other charges that are normally and customarily imposed or charged by a State or local government on all transactions or projects in the conduct of its operations, which are waived, foregone, or deferred (including State low-income housing tax credits) in a manner that achieves affordability of HOME-assisted projects, may be counted as match. The amount of any real estate taxes may be based on post-improvement property value. For taxes, fees, or charges that are forgiven for future years, the value is the present discounted cash value, based on a rate equal to the rate for the Treasury security with a maturity closest to the number of years for which the taxes, fees, or charges are waived, foregone, or deferred. 

(ii) Other charges or fees.  The value of fees or charges associated with the transfer or development of real estate that are normally and customarily imposed or charged by public or private entities, which are waived or foregone, in whole or in part, in a manner that achieves affordability of HOME-assisted projects, may be counted as match. Fees and charges under this paragraph do not include fees or charges for legal or other professional services; professional services which are donated, in whole or in part, are an eligible matching contribution in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section. 

(iii) Fees or charges that are associated with the HOME Program only (rather than normally and customarily imposed or charged on all transactions or projects) are not eligible forms of matching contributions. 

(3) Donated Real Property.  The value, before the HOME assistance is provided and minus any debt burden, lien, or other encumbrance, of donated land or other real property may be counted as match. The donation may be made by the participating jurisdiction, non-Federal public entities, private entities, or individuals, except as prohibited under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 

(i) Donated property not acquired with Federal resources is a contribution in the amount of 100% of the value. 

(ii) Donated property acquired with Federal assistance may provide a partial contribution as follows. The property must be acquired with Federal assistance specifically for a HOME project (or for affordable housing that will be counted as match pursuant to § 92.219(b)(2)). The property must be acquired with the Federal assistance at demonstrably below the appraised value and must be acknowledged by the seller as a donation to affordable housing at the time of the acquisition with the Federal assistance. The amount of the contribution is the difference between the acquisition price and the appraised value at the time of acquisition with the Federal assistance. If the property is acquired with the Federal assistance by someone other than the HOME project (or affordable housing) owner, to continue to qualify as a contribution, the property must be given to the HOME project (or affordable housing) owner at a price that does not exceed the amount of the Federal assistance used to acquire the property. 

(iii) Property must be appraised in conformance with established and generally recognized appraisal practice and procedures in common use by professional appraisers. Opinions of value must be based on the best available data properly analyzed and interpreted. The appraisal of land and structures must be performed by an independent, certified appraiser. 

(4) The cost, not paid with Federal resources, of on-site and off-site infrastructure that the participating jurisdiction documents are directly required for HOME-assisted projects. The infrastructure must have been completed no earlier than 12 months before HOME funds are committed to the project. 

(5) Proceeds from multifamily and single family affordable housing project bond financing validly issued by a State or local government, or an agency or instrumentality of a State or local government or a political subdivision of a State and repayable with revenues from the affordable housing project financed as follows: 

(i) Fifty percent of the loan amount made from bond proceeds to a multifamily affordable housing project owner may qualify as match. 

(ii) Twenty-five percent of the loan amount from bond proceeds made to a single-family affordable housing project owner may qualify as match. 

(iii) Loans made from bond proceeds may not constitute more than 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's total annual match contribution. 

(6) The reasonable value of donated site-preparation and construction materials, not acquired with Federal resources. The value of site-preparation and construction materials is to be determined in accordance with the participating jurisdiction's cost estimate procedures. 

(7) The reasonable rental value of the donated use of site preparation or construction equipment. 

(8) The value of donated or voluntary labor or professional services (see § 92.354(b)) in connection with the provision of affordable housing. A single rate established by HUD shall be applicable for determining the value of unskilled labor. The value of skilled labor or professional services shall be determined by the rate that the individual or entity performing the labor or service normally charges. 

(9) The value of sweat equity (see § 92.354(c)) provided to a homeownership project, under an established component of a participating jurisdiction's program, up until the time of project completion (i.e., submission of a project completion form). Such labor shall be valued at the rate established for unskilled labor at paragraph (a)(8) of this section. 

(10) The direct cost of supportive services provided to families residing in HOME-assisted units during the period of affordability or receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance during the term of the tenant-based rental assistance contract. The supportive services must be necessary to facilitate independent living or be required as part of a self-sufficiency program. Examples of supportive services include: case management, mental health services, assistance with the tasks of daily living, substance abuse treatment and counseling, day care, and job training and counseling. 

(11) The direct cost of homebuyer counseling services provided to families that acquire properties with HOME funds under the provisions of § 92.254(a), including ongoing counseling services provided during the period of affordability. These services may be provided as part of a homebuyer counseling program that is not specific to the HOME Program, but only the cost of services to families that complete purchases with HOME assistance may be counted as match. 

(b) Ineligible forms.  The following are examples that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and do not count toward meeting a participating jurisdiction's matching contribution requirement: 

(1) Contributions made with or derived from Federal resources or funds, regardless of when the Federal resources or funds were received or expended. CDBG funds (defined in 24 CFR 570.3) are Federal funds for this purpose; 

(2) The interest rate subsidy attributable to the Federal tax-exemption on financing or the value attributable to Federal tax credits; 

(3) Owner equity or investment in a project; and 

(4) Cash or other forms of contributions from applicants for or recipients of HOME assistance or contracts, or investors who own, are working on, or are proposing to apply for assistance for a HOME-assisted project. The prohibition in this paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to contractors (who do not own any HOME project) contributing professional services in accordance with paragraph (a)(8) of this section or to persons contributing sweat equity in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section. 

## § 92.221 Match credit. {#sec-221}

(a) When credit is given.  Contributions are credited on a fiscal year basis at the time the contribution is made, as follows: 

(1) A cash contribution is credited when the funds are expended. 

(2) The grant equivalent of a below-market interest rate loan is credited at the time of the loan closing. 

(3) The value of state or local taxes, fees, or other charges that are normally and customarily imposed but are waived, foregone, or deferred is credited at the time the state or local government or other public or private entity officially waives, forgoes, or defers the taxes, fees, or other charges and notifies the project owner. 

(4) The value of donated land or other real property is credited at the time ownership of the property is transferred to the HOME project (or affordable housing) owner. 

(5) The cost of investment in infrastructure directly required for HOME-assisted projects is credited at the time funds are expended for the infrastructure or at the time the HOME funds are committed to the project if the infrastructure was completed before the commitment of HOME funds. 

(6) The value of donated material is credited as match at the time it is used for affordable housing. 

(7) The value of the donate use of site preparation or construction equipment is credited as match at the time the equipment is used for affordable housing. 

(8) The value of donated or voluntary labor or professional services is credited at the time the work is performed. 

(9) A loan made from bond proceeds under § 92.220(a)(5) is credited at the time of the loan closing. 

(10) The direct cost of social services provided to residents of HOME-assisted units is credited at the time that the social services are provided during the period of affordability. 

(11) The direct cost of homebuyer counseling services provided to families that purchase HOME-assisted units is credited at the time that the homebuyer purchases the unit or for post-purchase counseling services, at the time the counseling services are provided. 

(b) Excess match.  Contributions made in a fiscal year that exceed the participating jurisdiction's match liability for the fiscal year in which they were made may be carried over and applied to future fiscal years' match liability. Loans made from bond proceeds in excess of 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's total annual match contribution may be carried over to subsequent fiscal years as excess match, subject to the annual 25 percent limitation. 

(c) Credit for match contributions shall be assigned as follows: 

(1) For HOME-assisted projects involving more than one participating jurisdiction, the participating jurisdiction that makes the match contribution may decide to retain the match credit or permit the other participating jurisdiction to claim the credit. 

(2) For HOME match contributions to affordable housing that is not HOME-assisted (match pursuant to § 92.219(b)) involving more than one participating jurisdiction, the participating jurisdiction that makes the match contribution receives the match credit. 

(3) A State that provides non-Federal funds to a local participating jurisdiction to be used for a contribution to affordable housing, whether or not HOME-assisted, may take the match credit for itself or may permit the local participating jurisdiction to receive the match credit. 

(d) Match credit for the development of affordable homeownership housing for sale to homebuyers. Contributions to the development of homeownership housing may be credited as a match only to the extent that the sales price of the housing is reduced by the amount of the contribution or, if the development costs exceed the fair market value of the housing, the contribution may be credited to the extent that the contributions enable the housing to be sold for less than the cost of development.

# Subpart F—Project Requirements {#subpart-F}

## § 92.250 Maximum per-unit subsidy amount, underwriting, and subsidy layering. {#sec-250}

(a) Maximum per-unit subsidy amount.  The total amount of HOME funds and ADDI funds that a participating jurisdiction may invest on a per-unit basis in affordable housing may not exceed the per-unit dollar limitations established under section 221(d)(3)(ii) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C.17151(d)(3)(ii)) for elevator- type projects that apply to the area in which the housing is located. HUD will allow the per-unit subsidy amount to be increased on a program-wide basis to an amount, up to 240 percent of the original per unit limits, to the extent that the costs of multifamily housing construction exceed the section 221(d)(3)(ii) limit. 

(b) Underwriting and subsidy layering.  Before committing funds to a project, the participating jurisdiction must evaluate the project in accordance with guidelines that it has adopted for determining a reasonable level of profit or return on owner's or developer's investment in a project and must not invest any more HOME funds, alone or in combination with other governmental assistance, than is necessary to provide quality affordable housing that is financially viable for a reasonable period (at minimum, the period of affordability in § 92.252 or § 92.254) and that will not provide a profit or return on the owner's or developer's investment that exceeds the participating jurisdiction's established standards for the size, type, and complexity of the project. The participating jurisdiction's guidelines must require the participating jurisdiction to undertake: 

(1) An examination of the sources and uses of funds for the project and a determination that the costs are reasonable; and 

(2) An assessment, at minimum, of the current market demand in the neighborhood in which the project will be located, the experience of the developer, the financial capacity of the developer, and firm written financial commitments for the project. 

(3) For projects involving rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing pursuant to § 92.254(b): 

(i) An underwriting analysis is required only if the HOME-funded rehabilitation loan is an amortizing loan; and 

(ii) A market analysis or evaluation of developer capacity is not required.

(3) Existing housing that is acquired for homeownership (e.g., downpayment assistance) must be decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair. The participating jurisdiction must establish standards to determine that the housing is decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair. At minimum, the standards must provide that the housing meets all applicable State and local housing quality standards and code requirements and the housing does not contain the specific deficiencies established by HUD based on the applicable standards in 24 CFR 5.703 and published in the Federal Register for HOME assisted projects and units. The participating jurisdiction must inspect the housing and document this compliance based upon an inspection that is conducted no earlier than 90 days before the commitment of HOME assistance. If the housing does not meet these standards, the housing must be rehabilitated to meet the standards of this paragraph (c)(3) or it cannot be acquired with HOME funds. 

### (d) [Reserved]  {#sec-251-d}

### (e) Manufactured housing.   {#sec-251-e}

Construction of all manufactured housing including manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of “reconstruction” must meet the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards codified at 24 CFR part 3280. These standards preempt State and local codes which are not identical to the federal standards for the new construction of manufactured housing. Participating jurisdictions providing HOME funds to assist manufactured housing units must comply with applicable State and local laws or codes. In the absence of such laws or codes, the installation must comply with the manufacturer's written instructions for installation of manufactured housing units. All new manufactured housing and all manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of “reconstruction” must be on a permanent foundation that meets the requirements for foundation systems as set forth in 24 CFR 203.43f(c)(i). All new manufactured housing and all manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of “reconstruction” must, at the time of project completion, be connected to permanent utility hook-ups and be located on land that is owned by the manufactured housing unit owner or land for which the manufactured housing owner has a lease for a period at least equal to the applicable period of affordability. In HOME-funded rehabilitation of existing manufactured housing the foundation and anchoring must meet all applicable State and local codes, ordinances, and requirements or in the absence of local or state codes, the Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards at 24 CFR part 3285. Manufactured housing that is rehabilitated using HOME funds must meet the property standards requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable. The participating jurisdiction must document this compliance in accordance with inspection procedures that the participating jurisdiction has established pursuant to § 92.251, as applicable. 

### (f) Ongoing property condition standards: Rental housing and housing occupied by tenants receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance — {#sec-251-f}

(1) Ongoing property standards.  The participating jurisdiction must establish property standards for rental housing (including manufactured housing) that apply throughout the affordability period and for housing occupied by tenants receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance. The standards must require that owners maintain the housing as decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair. The participating jurisdiction's description of its property standards must be in sufficient detail to establish the basis for a uniform inspection of HOME rental projects and housing occupied by tenants receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance. The participating jurisdiction's ongoing property standards must address each of the following: 

(i) Compliance with State and local codes, ordinances, and requirements.  The participating jurisdiction's standards must require the housing to meet all applicable State and local code requirements and ordinances. In the absence of existing applicable State or local code requirements and ordinances, at a minimum, the participating jurisdiction's ongoing property standards must provide that the property does not contain the specific deficiencies established by HUD based on the applicable standards in 24 CFR 5.703 and published in the Federal Register for rental housing (including manufactured housing) and housing occupied by tenants receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance. The requirements in 24 CFR 5.705 through 5.713 do not apply to the participating jurisdiction's ongoing property standards. 

(ii) Health and safety.  The participating jurisdiction's standards must require the housing to be free of all health and safety defects. The standards must identify life-threatening deficiencies that the owner must immediately correct and the time frames for addressing these deficiencies. 

(iii) Lead-based paint.  The participating jurisdiction's standards must require the housing to meet the lead-based paint requirements in 24 CFR part 35. 

(2) Projects to which HOME funds were committed before January 24, 2015 must meet all applicable State or local housing quality standards or code requirements, and if there are no such standard or code requirements, the housing must meet the housing quality standards in 24 CFR 982.401.

^[78 FR 44670, July 24, 2013, as amended at 81 FR 92635, Dec. 20, 2016; 88 FR 30496, May 11, 2023]

## § 92.252 Qualification as affordable housing: Rental housing. {#sec-252}

Cross Reference: Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 9663, Feb. 14, 2023.

The HOME-assisted units in a rental housing project must be occupied by households that are eligible as low- income families and must meet the requirements of this section to qualify as affordable housing. If the housing is not occupied by eligible tenants within six months following the date of project completion, HUD will require the participating jurisdiction to submit marketing information and, if appropriate, submit a marketing plan. HUD will require the participating jurisdiction to repay HOME funds invested in any housing unit that has not been rented to eligible tenants 18 months after the date of project completion. The affordability requirements also apply to the HOME- assisted non-owner-occupied units in single-family housing purchased with HOME funds in accordance with § 92.254. The tenant must have a written lease that complies with [§ 92.253](#sec-253). 

### (a) Rent limitation. {#sec-252-a}

HUD provides the following maximum HOME rent limits. The rent limits apply to the rent plus the utilities or the utility allowance. The maximum HOME rents (High HOME Rents) are the lesser of: 

(1) The fair market rent for existing housing for comparable units in the area as established by HUD under 24 CFR 888.111; or 

(2) A rent that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose annual income equals 65 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the unit. The HOME rent limits provided by HUD will include average occupancy per unit and adjusted income assumptions. 

### (b) Additional rent limitations (Low HOME Rents). {#sec-252-b}

The participating jurisdiction may designate (in its written agreement with the project owner) more than the minimum HOME units in a rental housing project, regardless of project size, to have Low HOME Rents that meet the requirements of this paragraph (b). In rental projects with five or more HOME-assisted rental units, at least 20 percent of the HOME-assisted units must be occupied by very low-income families and meet one of the following rent requirements: 

(1) The rent does not exceed 30 percent of the annual income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for smaller and larger families. HUD provides the HOME rent limits which include average occupancy per unit and adjusted income assumptions. However, if the rent determined under this paragraph is higher than the applicable rent under paragraph (a) of this section, then the maximum rent for units under this paragraph is that calculated under paragraph (a) of this section. 

(2) The rent does not exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted income. If the unit receives Federal or State project-based rental subsidy and the very low-income family pays as a contribution toward rent not more than 30 percent of the family's adjusted income, then the maximum rent (i.e., tenant contribution plus project-based rental subsidy) is the rent allowable under the Federal or State project-based rental subsidy program. 

### (c) Additional rent limitations for SRO projects. {#sec-252-c}

(1) For SRO units that have both sanitary and food preparation facilities, the maximum HOME rent is based on the zero-bedroom fair market rent. The project must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 

(2) For SRO units that have no sanitary or food preparation facilities or only one of the two, the maximum HOME rent is based on 75 percent of the zero-bedroom fair market rent. The project is not required to have low HOME rents in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, but must meet the occupancy requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. 

### (d) Initial rent schedule and utility allowances. {#sec-252-d}

(1) The participating jurisdiction must establish maximum monthly allowances for utilities and services (excluding telephone) and update the allowances annually. The participating jurisdiction must use the HUD Utility Schedule Model or otherwise determine the utility allowance for the project based on the type of utilities used at the project. 

(2) The participating jurisdiction must review and approve rents proposed by the owner for units, subject to the maximum rent limitations in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. For all units subject to the maximum rent limitations in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section for which the tenant is paying utilities and services, the participating jurisdiction must ensure that the rents do not exceed the maximum rent minus the monthly allowances for utilities and services. 

### (e) Periods of affordability. {#sec-252-e}

The HOME-assisted units must meet the affordability requirements for not less than the applicable period specified in the following table, beginning after project completion. 

(1) The affordability requirements: 

(i) Apply without regard to the term of any loan or mortgage, repayment of the HOME investment, or the transfer of ownership; 

(ii) Must be imposed by a deed restriction, a covenant running with the land, an agreement restricting the use of the property, or other mechanisms approved by HUD and must give the participating jurisdiction the right to require specific performance (except that the participating jurisdiction may provide that the affordability restrictions may terminate upon foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure); and 

(iii) Must be recorded in accordance with State recordation laws. 

(2) The participating jurisdiction may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the housing before foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to preserve affordability. 

(3) The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or any entity that includes the former owner or those with whom the former owner has or had family or business ties, obtains an ownership interest in the project or property. 

(4) The termination of the restrictions on the project does not terminate the participating jurisdiction's repayment obligation under § 92.503(b). 

Rental housing activity | Minimum period of affordability in years
---|---
Rehabilitation or acquisition of existing housing per unit amount of HOME funds: Under $15,000 | 5
\$15,000 to \$40,000 | 10
Over \$40,000 or rehabilitation involving refinancing | 15
New construction or acquisition of newly constructed housing | 20

### (f) Subsequent rents during the affordability period. {#sec-252-f}

(1) The maximum HOME rent limits are recalculated on a periodic basis after HUD determines fair market rents and median incomes. HUD then provides the new maximum HOME rent limits to participating jurisdictions. Regardless of changes in fair market rents and in median income over time, the HOME rents for a project are not required to be lower than the HOME rent limits for the project in effect at the time of project commitment. 

(2) The participating jurisdiction must provide project owners with information on updated HOME rent limits so that rents may be adjusted (not to exceed the maximum HOME rent limits in paragraph (f)(1) of this section) in accordance with the written agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the owner. Owners must annually provide the participating jurisdiction with information on rents and occupancy of HOME-assisted units to demonstrate compliance with this section. The participating jurisdiction must review rents for compliance and approve or disapprove them every year. 

(3) Any increase in rents for HOME-assisted units is subject to the provisions of outstanding leases, and in any event, the owner must provide tenants of those units not less than 30 days prior written notice before implementing any increase in rents. 

### (g) Adjustment of HOME rent limits for an existing project. {#sec-252-g}

(1) Changes in fair market rents and in median income over time should be sufficient to maintain the financial viability of a project within the HOME rent limits in this section. 

(2) HUD may adjust the HOME rent limits for a project, only if HUD finds that an adjustment is necessary to support the continued financial viability of the project and only by an amount that HUD determines is necessary to maintain continued financial viability of the project. HUD expects that this authority will be used sparingly. 

### (h) Tenant income. {#sec-252-h}

The income of each tenant must be determined initially in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(i). In addition, each year during the period of affordability the project owner must re-examine each tenant's annual income in accordance with one of the options in § 92.203 selected by the participating jurisdiction. An owner of a multifamily project with an affordability period of 10 years or more who re-examines tenant's annual income through a statement and certification in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(ii), must examine the income of each tenant, in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(i), every sixth year of the affordability period. Otherwise, an owner who accepts the tenant's statement and certification in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(ii) is not required to examine the income of tenants in multifamily or single-family projects unless there is evidence that the tenant's written statement failed to completely and accurately state information about the family's size or income. 

### (i) Over-income tenants. {#sec-252-i}

(1) HOME-assisted units continue to qualify as affordable housing despite a temporary noncompliance caused by increases in the incomes of existing tenants if actions satisfactory to HUD are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled in accordance with this section until the noncompliance is corrected. 

(2) Tenants who no longer qualify as low-income families must pay as rent the lesser of the amount payable by the tenant under State or local law or 30 percent of the family's adjusted income, except that tenants of HOME-assisted units that have been allocated low-income housing tax credits by a housing credit agency pursuant to section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 42) must pay rent governed by section 42. In addition, in projects in which the Home units are designated as floating pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section, tenants who no longer qualify as low-income are not required to pay as rent an amount that exceeds the market rent for comparable, unassisted units in the neighborhood. 

### (j) Fixed and floating HOME units. {#sec-252-j}

In a project containing HOME-assisted and other units, the participating jurisdiction may designate fixed or floating HOME units. This designation must be made at the time of project commitment in the written agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the owner, and the HOME units must be identified not later than the time of initial unit occupancy. Fixed units remain the same throughout the period of affordability. Floating units are changed to maintain conformity with the requirements of this section during the period of affordability so that the total number of housing units meeting the requirements of this section remains the same, and each substituted unit is comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms to the originally designated HOME-assisted unit. 

### (k) Tenant selection. {#sec-252-k}

The tenants must be selected in accordance with [§ 92.253(d)](#sec-253-d). 

### (l) Ongoing responsibilities. {#sec-252-l}

The participating jurisdiction's responsibilities for on-site inspections and financial oversight of rental projects are set forth in § 92.504(d). 

## § 92.253 Tenant protections and selection. {#sec-253}

### (a) Lease. {#sec-253-a}

There must be a written lease between the tenant and the owner of rental housing assisted with HOME funds that is for a period of not less than 1 year, unless by mutual agreement between the tenant and the owner a shorter period is specified. The lease must incorporate the VAWA lease term/addendum required under [§ 92.359(e)](#sec-359-e), except as otherwise provided by [§ 92.359(b)](#sec-359-b). 

### (b) Prohibited lease terms. {#sec-253-b}

The lease may not contain any of the following provisions: 

#### (1) Agreement to be sued. {#sec-253-b-1}

Agreement by the tenant to be sued, to admit guilt, or to a judgment in favor of the owner in a lawsuit brought in connection with the lease; 

#### (2) Treatment of property. {#sec-253-b-2}

Agreement by the tenant that the owner may take, hold, or sell personal property of household members without notice to the tenant and a court decision on the rights of the parties. This prohibition, however, does not apply to an agreement by the tenant concerning disposition of personal property remaining in the housing unit after the tenant has moved out of the unit.

#### (9) Mandatory supportive services. {#sec-253-b-9}

Agreement by the tenant (other than a tenant in transitional housing) to accept supportive services that are offered. 

### (c) Termination of tenancy. {#sec-253-c}

An owner may not terminate the tenancy or refuse to renew the lease of a tenant of rental housing assisted with HOME funds, except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease; for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law; for completion of the tenancy period for transitional housing or failure to follow any required transitional housing supportive services plan; or for other good cause. Good cause does not include an increase in the tenant's income or refusal of the tenant to purchase the housing. To terminate or refuse to renew tenancy, the owner must serve written notice upon the tenant specifying the grounds for the action at least 30 days before the termination of tenancy. 

### (d) Tenant selection. {#sec-253-d}

An owner of rental housing assisted with HOME funds must comply with the affirmative marketing requirements established by the participating jurisdiction pursuant to [§ 92.351(a)](#sec-351-a). The owner must adopt and follow written tenant selection policies and criteria that: 

(1) [](){#sec-253-d-1} Limit the housing to very low- income and low-income families; 

(2) [](){#sec-253-d-2} Are reasonably related to the applicants' ability to perform the obligations of the lease (i.e., to pay the rent, not to damage the housing; not to interfere with the rights and quiet enjoyment of other tenants); 

(3) [](){#sec-253-d-3} Limit eligibility or give a preference to a particular segment of the population if permitted in its written agreement with the participating jurisdiction (and only if the limitation or preference is described in the participating jurisdiction's consolidated plan). 

    (i) Any limitation or preference must not violate nondiscrimination requirements in [§ 92.350](#sec-350). A limitation or preference does not violate nondiscrimination requirements if the housing also receives funding from a Federal program that limits eligibility to a particular segment of the population (e.g., the Housing Opportunity for Persons with AIDS program under 24 CFR part 574, the Shelter Plus Care program under 24 CFR part 582, the Supportive Housing program under 24 CFR part 583, supportive housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities under 24 CFR part 891), and the limit or preference is tailored to serve that segment of the population. 

    (ii) If a project does not receive funding from a Federal program that limits eligibility to a particular segment of the population, the project may have a limitation or preference for persons with disabilities who need services offered at a project only if: 

      (A) The limitation or preference is limited to the population of families (including individuals) with disabilities that significantly interfere with their ability to obtain and maintain housing; 

      (B) Such families will not be able to obtain or maintain themselves in housing without appropriate supportive services; and 

      (C) Such services cannot be provided in a nonsegregated setting. The families must not be required to accept the services offered at the project. In advertising the project, the owner may advertise the project as offering services for a particular type of disability; however, the project must be open to all otherwise eligible persons with disabilities who may benefit from the services provided in the project. 

(4) [](){#sec-253-d-4} Do not exclude an applicant with a certificate or voucher under the Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program (24 CFR part 982) or an applicant participating in a HOME tenant-based rental assistance program because of the status of the prospective tenant as a holder of such certificate, voucher, or comparable HOME tenant-based assistance document. 

(5) [](){#sec-253-d-5} Provide for the selection of tenants from a written waiting list in the chronological order of their application, insofar as is practicable; 

(6) [](){#sec-253-d-6} Give prompt written notification to any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection; and 

(7) [](){#sec-253-d-7} Comply with the VAWA requirements prescribed in [§ 92.359](#sec-359). 

## § 92.254 Qualification as affordable housing: Homeownership. {#sec-254}

(a) Acquisition with or without rehabilitation.  Housing that is for acquisition by a family must meet the affordability requirements of this paragraph (a). 

(1) The housing must be single family housing. 

(2) The housing must be modest housing as follows: 

(i) In the case of acquisition of newly constructed housing or standard housing, the housing has a purchase price for the type of single family housing that does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. 

(ii) In the case of acquisition with rehabilitation, the housing has an estimated value after rehabilitation that does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. 

(iii) If a participating jurisdiction intends to use HOME funds for homebuyer assistance or for the rehabilitation of owner-occupied single- family properties, the participating jurisdiction must use the HOME affordable homeownership limits provided by HUD for newly constructed housing and for existing housing. HUD will provide limits for affordable newly constructed housing based on 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area using Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage program data for newly constructed housing, with a minimum limit based on 95 percent of the U.S. median purchase price for new construction for nonmetropolitan areas. HUD will provide limits for affordable existing housing based on 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area using Federal FHA single family mortgage program data for existing housing data and other appropriate data that are available nation-wide for sales of existing housing, with a minimum limit based on 95 percent of the state-wide nonmetropolitan area median purchase price using this data. In lieu of the limits provided by HUD, the participating jurisdiction may determine 95 percent of the median area purchase price for single family housing in the jurisdiction annually, as follows. The participating jurisdiction must set forth the price for different types of single family housing for the jurisdiction. The participating jurisdiction may determine separate limits for existing housing and newly constructed housing. For housing located outside of metropolitan areas, a State may aggregate sales data from more than one county, if the counties are contiguous and similarly situated. The following information must be included in the annual action plan of the Consolidated Plan submitted to HUD for review and updated in each action plan. 

(A) The 95 percent of median area purchase price must be established in accordance with a market analysis that ensured that a sufficient number of recent housing sales are included in the survey. 

(B) Sales must cover the requisite number of months based on volume: For 500 or more sales per month, a one- month reporting period; for 250 through 499 sales per month, a 2-month reporting period; for less than 250 sales per month, at least a 3-month reporting period. The data must be listed in ascending order of sales price. 

(C) The address of the listed properties must include the location within the participating jurisdiction. Lot, square, and subdivision data may be substituted for the street address. 

(D) The housing sales data must reflect all, or nearly all, of the one- family house sales in the entire participating jurisdiction. 

(E) To determine the median, take the middle sale on the list if an odd number of sales, and if an even number, take the higher of the middle numbers and consider it the median. After identifying the median sales price, the amount should be multiplied by 0.95 to determine the 95 percent of the median area purchase price. 

(3) The housing must be acquired by a homebuyer whose family qualifies as a low-income family, and the housing must be the principal residence of the family throughout the period described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If there is no ratified sales contract with an eligible homebuyer for the housing within 9 months of the date of completion of construction or rehabilitation, the housing must be rented to an eligible tenant in accordance with § 92.252. In determining the income eligibility of the family, the participating jurisdiction must include the income of all persons living in the housing. The homebuyer must receive housing counseling. 

(4) Periods of affordability.  The HOME-assisted housing must meet the affordability requirements for not less than the applicable period specified in the following table, beginning after project completion. The per unit amount of HOME funds and the affordability period that they trigger are described more fully in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) (resale) and (ii) (recapture) of this section. 

Homeownership assistance HOME amount per-unit | Minimum period of affordability in years
---|---
Under \$15,000 | 5
\$15,000 to \$40,000 | 10
Over $40,000 | 15

(5) Resale and recapture.  The participating jurisdiction must establish the resale or recapture requirements that comply with the standards of this section and set forth the requirements in its consolidated plan. HUD must determine that they are appropriate and must specifically approve them in writing. 

(i) Resale.  Resale requirements must ensure, if the housing does not continue to be the principal residence of the family for the duration of the period of affordability that the housing is made available for subsequent purchase only to a buyer whose family qualifies as a low-income family and will use the property as the family's principal residence. The resale requirement must also ensure that the price at resale provides the original HOME-assisted owner a fair return on investment (including the homeowner's investment and any capital improvement) and ensure that the housing will remain affordable to a reasonable range of low- income homebuyers. The participating jurisdiction must specifically define “fair return on investment” and “affordability to a reasonable range of low-income homebuyers,” and specifically address how it will make the housing affordable to a low-income homebuyer in the event that the resale price necessary to provide fair return is not affordable to the subsequent buyer. The period of affordability is based on the total amount of HOME funds invested in the housing. 

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section, deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other similar mechanisms must be used as the mechanism to impose the resale requirements. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon occurrence of any of the following termination events: foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure or assignment of an FHA insured mortgage to HUD. The participating jurisdiction may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the housing before foreclosure to preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the termination event, obtains an ownership interest in the housing. 

(B) Certain housing may be presumed to meet the resale restrictions (i.e., the housing will be available and affordable to a reasonable range of low-income homebuyers; a low-income homebuyer will occupy the housing as the family's principal residence; and the original owner will be afforded a fair return on investment) during the period of affordability without the imposition of enforcement mechanisms by the participating jurisdiction. The presumption must be based upon a market analysis of the neighborhood in which the housing is located. The market analysis must include an evaluation of the location and characteristics of the housing and residents in the neighborhood (e.g., sale prices, age and amenities of the housing stock, incomes of residents, percentage of owner-occupants) in relation to housing and incomes in the housing market area. An analysis of the current and projected incomes of neighborhood residents for an average period of affordability for homebuyers in the neighborhood must support the conclusion that a reasonable range of low-income families will continue to qualify for mortgage financing. For example, an analysis shows that the housing is modestly priced within the housing market area and that families with incomes of 65% to 80% of area median can afford monthly payments under average FHA terms without other government assistance and housing will remain affordable at least during the next five to seven years compared to other housing in the market area; the size and amenities of the housing are modest and substantial rehabilitation will not significantly increase the market value; the neighborhood has housing that is not currently owned by the occupants, but the participating jurisdiction is encouraging homeownership in the neighborhood by providing homeownership assistance and by making improvements to the streets, sidewalks, and other public facilities and services. If a participating jurisdiction in preparing a neighborhood revitalization strategy under § 91.215(e)(2) of its consolidated plan or Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community application under 24 CFR part 597 has incorporated the type of market data described above, that submission may serve as the required analysis under this section. If the participating jurisdiction continues to provide homeownership assistance for housing in the neighborhood, it must periodically update the market analysis to verify the original presumption of continued affordability. 

(ii) Recapture.  Recapture provisions must ensure that the participating jurisdiction recoups all or a portion of the HOME assistance to the homebuyers, if the housing does not continue to be the principal residence of the family for the duration of the period of affordability. The participating jurisdiction may structure its recapture provisions based on its program design and market conditions. The period of affordability is based upon the total amount of HOME funds subject to recapture described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A)(5) of this section. Recapture provisions may permit the subsequent homebuyer to assume the HOME assistance (subject to the HOME requirements for the remainder of the period of affordability) if the subsequent homebuyer is low-income, and no additional HOME assistance is provided. 

(A) The following options for recapture requirements are acceptable to HUD. The participating jurisdiction may adopt, modify or develop its own recapture requirements for HUD approval. In establishing its recapture requirements, the participating jurisdiction is subject to the limitation that when the recapture requirement is triggered by a sale (voluntary or involuntary) of the housing unit, the amount recaptured cannot exceed the net proceeds, if any. The net proceeds are the sales price minus superior loan repayment (other than HOME funds) and any closing costs. 

(1) Recapture entire amount.  The participating jurisdiction may recapture the entire amount of the HOME investment from the homeowner. 

(2) Reduction during affordability period.  The participating jurisdiction may reduce the HOME investment amount to be recaptured on a prorata basis for the time the homeowner has owned and occupied the housing measured against the required affordability period. 

(3) Shared net proceeds.  If the net proceeds are not sufficient to recapture the full HOME investment (or a reduced amount as provided for in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A)(2) of this section) plus enable the homeowner to recover the amount of the homeowner's downpayment and any capital improvement investment made by the owner since purchase, the participating jurisdiction may share the net proceeds. The net proceeds are the sales price minus loan repayment (other than HOME funds) and closing costs. The net proceeds may be divided proportionally as set forth in the following mathematical formulas: 

(4) Owner investment returned first.  The participating jurisdiction may permit the homebuyer to recover the homebuyer's entire investment (downpayment and capital improvements made by the owner since purchase) before recapturing the HOME investment. 

(5) Amount subject to recapture.  The HOME investment that is subject to recapture is based on the amount of HOME assistance that enabled the homebuyer to buy the dwelling unit. This includes any HOME assistance that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an affordable price, but excludes the amount between the cost of producing the unit and the market value of the property (i.e., the development subsidy). The recaptured funds must be used to carry out HOME-eligible activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. If the HOME assistance is only used for the development subsidy and therefore not subject to recapture, the resale option must be used. 

(6) Special considerations for single-family properties with more than one unit.  If the HOME funds are only used to assist a low-income homebuyer to acquire one unit in single-family housing containing more than one unit and the assisted unit will be the principal residence of the homebuyer, the affordability requirements of this section apply only to the assisted unit. If HOME funds are also used to assist the low-income homebuyer to acquire one or more of the rental units in the single-family housing, the affordability requirements of § 92.252 apply to assisted rental units, except that the participating jurisdiction may impose resale or recapture restrictions on all assisted units (owner-occupied and rental units) in the single family housing. If resale restrictions are used, the affordability requirements on all assisted units continue for the period of affordability. If recapture restrictions are used, the affordability requirements on the assisted rental units may be terminated, at the discretion of the participating jurisdiction, upon recapture of the HOME investment. (If HOME funds are used to assist only the rental units in such a property then the requirements of § 92.252 would apply and the owner-occupied unit would not be subject to the income targeting or affordability provisions of § 92.254.) 

(7) Lease-purchase.  HOME funds may be used to assist homebuyers through lease-purchase programs for existing housing and for housing to be constructed. The housing must be purchased by a homebuyer within 36 months of signing the lease'purchase agreement. The homebuyer must qualify as a low-income family at the time the lease-purchase agreement is signed. If HOME funds are used to acquire housing that will be resold to a homebuyer through a lease-purchase program, the HOME affordability requirements for rental housing in § 92.252 shall apply if the housing is not transferred to a homebuyer within forty-two months after project completion. 

(8) Contract to purchase.  If HOME funds are used to assist a homebuyer who has entered into a contract to purchase housing to be constructed, the homebuyer must qualify as a low-income family at the time the contract is signed. 

(9) Preserving affordability of housing that was previously assisted with HOME funds. 

(i) To preserve the affordability of HOME-assisted housing a participating jurisdiction may use additional HOME funds for the following costs: 

(A) The cost to acquire the housing through a purchase option, right of first refusal, or other preemptive right before foreclosure, or at the foreclosure sale. (The foreclosure costs to acquire housing with a HOME loan in default are eligible. However, HOME funds may not be used to repay a loan made with HOME funds.) 

(B) The cost to undertake any necessary rehabilitation for the housing acquired. 

(C) The cost of owning/holding the housing pending resale to another homebuyer. 

(D) The cost to assist another homebuyer in purchasing the housing. 

(ii) When a participating jurisdiction uses HOME funds to preserve the affordability of such housing, the additional investment must be treated as an amendment to the original project. The housing must be sold to a new eligible homebuyer in accordance with the requirements of § 92.254(a) within a reasonable period of time. 

(iii) The total amount of the original and additional HOME assistance may not exceed the maximum per unit subsidy amount established under § 92.250. Alternatively to charging the cost to the HOME program under § 92.206, the participating jurisdiction may charge the cost to the HOME program under § 92.207 as a reasonable administrative cost of its HOME program, so that the additional HOME funds for the housing are not subject to the maximum per-unit subsidy amount. To the extent administrative funds are used, they may be reimbursed, in whole or in part, when the housing is sold to a new eligible homebuyer. 

(b) Rehabilitation not involving acquisition.  Housing that is currently owned by a family qualifies as affordable housing only if: 

(1) The estimated value of the property, after rehabilitation, does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section; and 

(2) The housing is the principal residence of an owner whose family qualifies as a low-income family at the time HOME funds are committed to the housing. In determining the income eligibility of the family, the participating jurisdiction must include the income of all persons living in the housing. 

(c) Ownership interest.  The ownership in the housing assisted under this section must meet the definition of “homeownership” in § 92.2, except that housing that is rehabilitated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may also include inherited property with multiple owners, life estates, living trusts and beneficiary deeds under the following conditions. The participating jurisdiction has the right to establish the terms of assistance. 

(1) Inherited property.  Inherited property with multiple owners: Housing for which title has been passed to several individuals by inheritance, but not all heirs reside in the housing, sharing ownership with other nonresident heirs. (The occupant of the housing has a divided ownership interest.) The participating jurisdiction may assist the owner-occupant if the occupant is low-income, occupies the housing as his or her principal residence, and pays all the costs associated with ownership and maintenance of the housing (e.g., mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities). 

(2) Life estate.  The person who has the life estate has the right to live in the housing for the remainder of his or her life and does not pay rent. The participating jurisdiction may assist the person holding the life estate if the person is low-income and occupies the housing as his or her principal residence. 

(3) Inter vivos trust, also known as a living trust.  A living trust is created during the lifetime of a person. A living trust is created when the owner of property conveys his or her property to a trust for his or her own benefit or for that of a third party (the beneficiaries). The trust holds legal title and the beneficiary holds equitable title. The person may name him or herself as the beneficiary. The trustee is under a fiduciary responsibility to hold and manage the trust assets for the beneficiary. The participating jurisdiction may assist if all beneficiaries of the trust qualify as a low-income family and occupy the property as their principal residence (except that contingent beneficiaries, who receive no benefit from the trust nor have any control over the trust assets until the beneficiary is deceased, need not be low-income). The trust must be valid and enforceable and ensure that each beneficiary has the legal right to occupy the property for the remainder of his or her life. 

(4) Beneficiary deed.  A beneficiary deed conveys an interest in real property, including any debt secured by a lien on real property, to a grantee beneficiary designated by the owner and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the owner. Upon the death of the owner, the grantee beneficiary receives ownership in the property, subject to all conveyances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges, and other encumbrances made by the owner or to which the owner was subject during the owner's lifetime. The participating jurisdiction may assist if the owner qualifies as low-income and the owner occupies the property as his or her principal residence. 

(d) New construction without acquisition.  Newly constructed housing that is built on property currently owned by a family which will occupy the housing upon completion, qualifies as affordable housing if it meets the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section. 

(e) Providing homeownership assistance through lenders.  Subject to the requirements of this paragraph (e), the participating jurisdiction may provide homeownership assistance through for-profit or nonprofit lending institutions that provide the first mortgage loan to a low-income family. 

(1) The homeownership assistance may be provided only as specified in a written agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the lender. The written agreement must specify the forms and amounts of homeownership assistance that the participating jurisdiction authorizes the lender to provide to families and any conditions that apply to the provision of such homeownership assistance. 

(2) Before the lender provides any homeownership assistance to a family, the participating jurisdiction must verify that the family is low-income and must inspect the housing for compliance with the property standards in § 92.251. 

(3) No fees (e.g., origination fees or points) may be charged to a family for the HOME homeownership assistance provided pursuant to this paragraph (e), and the participating jurisdiction must determine that the fees and other amounts charged to the family by the lender for the first mortgage financing are reasonable. Reasonable administrative costs may be charged to the HOME program as a project cost. If the participating jurisdiction requires lenders to pay a fee to participate in the HOME program, the fee is program income to the HOME program. 

(4) If the nonprofit lender is a subrecipient or contractor that is receiving HOME assistance to determine that the family is eligible for homeownership assistance, but the participating jurisdiction or another entity is making the assistance to the homebuyer (e.g., signing the documents for the loan or the grant), the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section are applicable. 

(f) Homebuyer program policies.  The participating jurisdiction must have and follow written policies for: 

(1) Underwriting standards for homeownership assistance that evaluate housing debt and overall debt of the family, the appropriateness of the amount of assistance, monthly expenses of the family, assets available to acquire the housing, and financial resources to sustain homeownership; 

(2) Responsible lending, and 

(3) Refinancing loans to which HOME loans are subordinated to ensure that the terms of the new loan are reasonable.

## § 92.255 Converting rental units to homeownership units for existing tenants. {#sec-255}

(a) The participating jurisdiction may permit the owner of HOME-assisted rental units to convert the rental units to homeownership units by selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the units to the existing tenants to enable the tenants to become homeowners in accordance with the requirements of § 92.254. However, refusal by the tenant to purchase the housing does not constitute grounds for eviction or for failure to renew the lease. 

(b) If no additional HOME funds are used to enable the tenants to become homeowners, the homeownership units are subject to a minimum period of affordability equal to the remaining affordable period if the units continued as rental units. If additional HOME funds are used to directly assist the tenants to become homeowners, the minimum period of affordability is the affordability period under § 92.254(a)(4), based on the amount of direct homeownership assistance provided. 

## § 92.256 [Reserved] {#sec-256}

## § 92.257 Equal participation of faith-based organizations. {#sec-257}

The HUD program requirements in § 5.109 apply to the HOME program, including the requirements regarding disposition and change in use of real property by a faith-based organization. 

## § 92.258 Elder cottage housing opportunity (ECHO) units. {#sec-258}

(a) General.  HOME funds may be used for the initial purchase and initial placement costs of elder cottage housing opportunity (ECHO) units that meet the requirements of this section, and that are small, free-standing, barrier-free, energy-efficient, removable, and designed to be installed adjacent to existing single-family dwellings. 

(b) Eligible owners.  The owner of a HOME-assisted ECHO unit may be: 

(1) The owner-occupant of the single-family host property on which the ECHO unit will be located; 

(2) A participating jurisdiction; or 

(3) A non-profit organization. 

(c) Eligible tenants.  During the affordability period, the tenant of a HOME-assisted ECHO unit must be an elderly or disabled family as defined in 24 CFR 5.403 and must also be a low-income family. 

(d) Applicable requirements.  The requirements of § 92.252 apply to HOME-assisted ECHO units, with the following modifications: 

(1) Only one ECHO unit may be provided per host property. 

(2) The ECHO unit owner may choose whether or not to charge the tenant of the ECHO unit rent, but if a rent is charged, it must meet the requirements of § 92.252. 

(3) The ECHO housing must remain affordable for the period specified in § 92.252(e). If within the affordability period the original occupant no longer occupies the unit, the ECHO unit owner must: 

(i) Rent the unit to another eligible occupant on site; 

(ii) Move the ECHO unit to another site for occupancy by an eligible occupant; or 

(iii) If the owner of the ECHO unit is the host property owner-occupant, the owner may repay the HOME funds in accordance with the recapture provisions imposed by the participating jurisdiction consistent with § 92.254(a)(5)(ii). The participating jurisdiction must use the recaptured HOME funds for additional HOME activities. 

(4) The participating jurisdiction has the responsibility to enforce the project requirements applicable to ECHO units. 

# Subpart G—Community Housing Development Organizations {#subpart-G}

## § 92.300 Set-aside for community housing development organizations (CHDOs). {#sec-300}

(a) Within 24 months after the date that HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnerships Agreement, the participating jurisdiction must reserve not less than 15 percent of the HOME allocation for investment only in housing to be owned, developed or sponsored by community housing development organizations. For a State, the HOME allocation includes funds reallocated under § 92.451(c)(2)(i) and, for a unit of general local government, includes funds transferred from a State under § 92.102(b). The participating jurisdiction must certify the organization as meeting the definition of “community housing development organization” and must document that the organization has capacity to own, develop, or sponsor housing each time it commits funds to the organization. For purposes of this paragraph: 

    (1) [](){#sec-300-a-1} Funds are reserved when a participating jurisdiction enters into a written agreement with the community housing development organization (or project owner as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) committing the funds to a specific local project in accordance with paragraph (2) of the definition of “commitment” in § 92.2. 

    (2) [](){#sec-300-a-2} Rental housing is “owned” by the community housing development organization if the community housing development organization is the owner in fee simple absolute of multifamily or single family housing (or has a long term ground lease) for rental to low-income families in accordance with § 92.252. If the housing is to be rehabilitated or constructed, the community housing development organization hires and oversees the developer that rehabilitates or constructs the housing. At minimum, the community housing development organization must hire or contract with an experienced project manager to oversee all aspects of the development, including obtaining zoning, securing non-HOME financing, selecting a developer or general contractor, overseeing the progress of the work and determining the reasonableness of costs. The community housing development organization must own the rental housing during development and for a period at least equal to the period of affordability in § 92.252. If the CHDO acquires housing that meets the property standards in § 92.251, the CHDO must own the rental housing for a period at least equal to the period of affordability in § 92.252. 

    (3) [](){#sec-300-a-3} Rental housing is “developed” by the community development housing organization if the community housing development organization is the owner of multifamily or single family housing in fee simple absolute (or has a long term ground lease) and the developer of new housing that will be constructed or existing substandard housing that will be rehabilitated for rent to low-income families in accordance with § 92.252. To be the “developer,” the community development housing organization must be in sole charge of all aspects of the development process, including obtaining zoning, securing non-HOME financing, selecting architects, engineers and general contractors, overseeing the progress of the work and determining the reasonableness of costs. At a minimum, the community housing development organization must own the housing during development and for a period at least equal to the period of affordability in § 92.252.

## § 92.351 Affirmative marketing; minority outreach program. {#sec-351}

### (a) Affirmative marketing. {#sec-351-a}

(1) Each participating jurisdiction must adopt and follow affirmative marketing procedures and requirements for rental and homebuyer projects containing five or more HOME-assisted housing units. Affirmative marketing requirements and procedures also apply to all HOME- funded programs, including, but not limited to, tenant-based rental assistance and downpayment assistance programs. Affirmative marketing steps consist of actions to provide information and otherwise attract eligible persons in the housing market area to the available housing without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, religion, familial status, or disability. If participating jurisdiction's written agreement with the project owner permits the rental housing project to limit tenant eligibility or to have a tenant preference in accordance with [§ 92.253(d)(3)](#sec-253-d-3), the participating jurisdiction must have affirmative marketing procedures and requirements that apply in the context of the limited/preferred tenant eligibility for the project. 

(2) The affirmative marketing requirements and procedures adopted must include: 

    (i) Methods for informing the public, owners, and potential tenants about Federal fair housing laws and the participating jurisdiction's affirmative marketing policy (e.g., the use of the Equal Housing Opportunity logotype or slogan in press releases and solicitations for owners, and written communication to fair housing and other groups); 

    (ii) Requirements and practices each subrecipient and owner must adhere to in order to carry out the participating jurisdiction's affirmative marketing procedures and requirements (e.g., use of commercial media, use of community contacts, use of the Equal Housing Opportunity logotype or slogan, and display of fair housing poster); 

    (iii) Procedures to be used by subrecipients and owners to inform and solicit applications from persons in the housing market area who are not likely to apply for the housing program or the housing without special outreach (e.g., through the use of community organizations, places of worship, employment centers, fair housing groups, or housing counseling agencies); 

    (iv) Records that will be kept describing actions taken by the participating jurisdiction and by subrecipients and owners to affirmatively market the program and units and records to assess the results of these actions; and 

    (v) A description of how the participating jurisdiction will annually assess the success of affirmative marketing actions and what corrective actions will be taken where affirmative marketing requirements are not met. 

(3) A State that distributes HOME funds to units of general local government must require each unit of general local government to adopt affirmative marketing procedures and requirements that meet the requirement in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 

### (b) Minority outreach. {#sec-351-b}

A participating jurisdiction must prescribe procedures acceptable to HUD to establish and oversee a minority outreach program within its jurisdiction to ensure the inclusion, to the maximum extent possible, of minorities and women, and entities owned by minorities and women, including, without limitation, real estate firms, construction firms, appraisal firms, management firms, financial institutions, investment banking firms, underwriters, accountants, and providers of legal services, in all contracts entered into by the participating jurisdiction with such persons or entities, public and private, in order to facilitate the activities of the participating jurisdiction to provide affordable housing authorized under this Act or any other Federal housing law applicable to such jurisdiction. Section 200.321 of title 2 Code of Federal Regulations describes actions to be taken by a participating jurisdiction to assure that minority business enterprises and women business enterprises are used when possible in the procurement of property and services. 

## § 92.352 Environmental review.

(a) General.  The environmental effects of each activity carried out with HOME funds must be assessed in accordance with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321) and the related authorities listed in HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 50 and 58. The applicability of the provisions of 24 CFR part 50 or part 58 is based on the HOME project (new construction, rehabilitation, acquisition) or activity (tenant-based rental assistance) as a whole, not on the type of the cost paid with HOME funds. 

(b) Responsibility for review. 

(1) The jurisdiction (e.g., the participating jurisdiction or State recipient) or insular area must assume responsibility for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action for each activity that it carries out with HOME funds, in accordance with the requirements imposed on a recipient under 24 CFR part 58. No funds may be committed to a HOME activity or project before the completion of the environmental review and approval of the request for release of funds and related certification, except as authorized by 24 CFR part 58. 

(2) A State participating jurisdiction must also assume responsibility for approval of requests for release of HOME funds submitted by State recipients. 

(3) HUD will perform the environmental review, in accordance with 24 CFR part 50, for a competitively awarded application for HOME funds submitted to HUD by an entity that is not a jurisdiction. 

## § 92.353 Displacement, relocation, and acquisition.

## (a) Minimizing displacement. {#sec-353-a}

Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, the participating jurisdiction must ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted with HOME funds. To the extent feasible, residential tenants must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable dwelling unit in the building/complex upon completion of the project. 

## (b) Temporary relocation. {#sec-353-b}

The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided: 

(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly rent/utility costs. 

(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of: 

    (i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation; 

    (ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period; 

    (iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex upon completion of the project; and 

    (iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 

## (c) Relocation assistance for displaced persons {#sec-353-c}

### (1) General. {#sec-353-c-1}

A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201–4655) and 49 CFR part 24. A “displaced person” must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act and, if the comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, the minority person also must be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas. 

### (2) Displaced Person. {#sec-353-c-2}

(i) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term displaced person means a person (family individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm, including any corporation, partnership or association) that moves from real property or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted with HOME funds. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made: 

    (A) After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after: 

        (1) The date of the submission of an application to the participating jurisdiction or HUD, if the applicant has site control and the application is later approved; or 

        (2) The date the jurisdiction approves the applicable site, if the applicant does not have site control at the time of the application; or 

    (B) Before the date described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, if the jurisdiction or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project; or 

    (C) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs: 

        (1) The tenant moves after execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering the tenant the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a term of at least one year at a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of: 

            (i) The tenant's monthly rent before such agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or 

            (ii) The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 5.628, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income; 

        (2) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either 

            (i) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or 

            (ii) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or 

        (3) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable. 

(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a displaced person if: 

    (A) The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the participating jurisdiction determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance. The effective date of any termination or refusal to renew must be preceded by at least 30 days advance written notice to the tenant specifying the grounds for the action. 

    (B) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application but, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, incur a rent increase), and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance under this section) as a result of the project; 

    (C) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or 

    (D) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project. 

(iii) The jurisdiction may, at any time, ask HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this rule. 

### (3) Initiation of negotiations. {#sec-353-c-3}

For purposes of determining the formula for computing replacement housing assistance to be provided under paragraph (c) of this section to a tenant displaced from a dwelling as a direct result of private-owner rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition of the real property, the term initiation of negotiations means the execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition. 

## (d) Optional relocation assistance. {#sec-353-d}

The participating jurisdiction may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance to families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms displaced by a project assisted with HOME funds where the displacement is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The jurisdiction may also provide relocation assistance to persons covered under paragraph (c) of this section beyond that required. For any such assistance that is not required by State or local law, the jurisdiction must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the optional relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons. 

## (e) Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan. {#sec-353-e}

The participating jurisdiction shall comply with the requirements of 24 CFR part 42, subpart C. 

## (f) Real property acquisition requirements. {#sec-353-f}

The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. 

## (g) Appeals. {#sec-353-g}

A person who disagrees with the participating jurisdiction's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a displaced person, or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person may be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the jurisdiction. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the jurisdiction's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office. 

## § 92.354 Labor. {#sec-354}

### (a) General. {#sec-354-b}

(1) Every contract for the construction (rehabilitation or new construction) of housing that includes 12 or more units assisted with HOME funds must contain a provision requiring the payment of not less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141), to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of any part of the housing. Such contracts must also be subject to the overtime provisions, as applicable, of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701). 

(2) The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions if HOME funds are used for any project costs in § 92.206, including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME-assisted units. When HOME funds are only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single-family housing, and not for any other project costs, the wage provisions apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that HOME funds will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing and the construction contract covers 12 or more housing units to be purchased with HOME assistance. The wage provisions apply to any construction contract that includes a total of 12 or more HOME-assisted units, whether one or more than one project is covered by the construction contract. Once they are determined to be applicable, the wage provisions must be contained in the construction contract so as to cover all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project, including portions other than the assisted units. Arranging multiple construction contracts within a single project for the purpose of avoiding the wage provisions is not permitted. 

(3) Participating jurisdictions, contractors, subcontractors, and other participants must comply with regulations issued under these acts and with other Federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor standards, as applicable. Participating jurisdictions shall be responsible for ensuring compliance by contractors and subcontractors with labor standards described in this section. In accordance with procedures specified by HUD, participating jurisdictions shall: 

    (i) Ensure that bid and contract documents contain required labor standards provisions and the appropriate Department of Labor wage determinations; 

    (ii) Conduct on-site inspections and employee interviews; 

    (iii) Collect and review certified weekly payroll reports; 

    (iv) Correct all labor standards violations promptly; 

    (v) Maintain documentation of administrative and enforcement activities; and 

    (vi) Require certification as to compliance with the provisions of this section before making any payment under such contracts. 

### (b) Volunteers. {#sec-354-b}

The prevailing wage provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to an individual who receives no compensation or is paid expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee to perform the services for which the individual volunteered and who is not otherwise employed at any time in the construction work. See 24 CFR part 70. 

### (c) Sweat equity. {#sec-354-b}

The prevailing wage provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to members of an eligible family who provide labor in exchange for acquisition of a property for homeownership or provide labor in lieu of, or as a supplement to, rent payments. 

## § 92.355 Lead-based paint. {#sec-355}

Housing assisted with HOME funds is subject to the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821–4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851–4856), and implementing regulations at part 35, subparts A, B, J, K, M and R of this title. 

## § 92.356 Conflict of interest. {#sec-356}

### (a) Applicability. {#sec-356-a}

In the procurement of property and services by participating jurisdictions, State recipients, and subrecipients, the conflict of interest provisions in 2 CFR 200.317 and 2 CFR 200.318, apply. In all cases not governed by 2 CFR 200.317 and 2 CFR 200.318, the provisions of this section apply. 

### (b) Conflicts prohibited. {#sec-356-b}

No persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted with HOME funds or who are in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to these activities may obtain a financial interest or financial benefit from a HOME-assisted activity, or have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect to the HOME-assisted activity, or the proceeds from such activity, either for themselves or those with whom they have business or immediate family ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter. Immediate family ties include (whether by blood, marriage or adoption) the spouse, parent (including a stepparent), child (including a stepchild), brother, sister (including a stepbrother or stepsister), grandparent, grandchild, and in-laws of a covered person. 

### (c) Persons covered. {#sec-356-c}

The conflict of interest provisions of paragraph (b) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the participating jurisdiction, State recipient, or subrecipient which are receiving HOME funds. 

### (d) Exceptions: Threshold requirements. {#sec-356-d}

Upon the written request of the participating jurisdiction, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and the effective and efficient administration of the participating jurisdiction's program or project. An exception may be considered only after the participating jurisdiction has provided the following: 

(1) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and 

(2) An opinion of the participating jurisdiction's or State recipient's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law. 

### (e) Factors to be considered for exceptions. {#sec-356-e}

In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the participating jurisdiction has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, HUD will consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable: 

(1) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project which would otherwise not be available; 

(2) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class; 

(3) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question; 

(4) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (c) of this section; 

(5) Whether undue hardship will result either to the participating jurisdiction or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and 

(6) Any other relevant considerations. 

### (f) Owners and developers. {#sec-356-f}

(1) No owner, developer, or sponsor of a project assisted with HOME funds (or officer, employee, agent, elected or appointed official, or consultant of the owner, developer, or sponsor or immediate family member or immediate family member of an officer, employee, agent, elected or appointed official, or consultant of the owner, developer, or sponsor) whether private, for-profit or nonprofit (including a community housing development organization (CHDO) when acting as an owner, developer, or sponsor) may occupy a HOME-assisted affordable housing unit in a project during the required period of affordability specified in § 92.252(e) or § 92.254(a)(4). This provision does not apply to an individual who receives HOME funds to acquire or rehabilitate his or her principal residence or to an employee or agent of the owner or developer of a rental housing project who occupies a housing unit as the project manager or maintenance worker. 

(2) Exceptions.  Upon written request of a housing owner or developer, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient, if authorized by the State participating jurisdiction) may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HOME program and the effective and efficient administration of the owner's or developer's HOME-assisted project. In determining whether to grant a requested exception, the participating jurisdiction shall consider the following factors: 

    (i) Whether the person receiving the benefit is a member of a group or class of low-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted housing, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class; 

    (ii) Whether the person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted housing in question; 

    (iii) Whether the tenant protection requirements of § 92.253 are being observed; 

    (iv) Whether the affirmative marketing requirements of § 92.351 are being observed and followed; and 

    (v) Any other factor relevant to the participating jurisdiction's determination, including the timing of the requested exception.

### (a) General. {#sec-357-a}

Executive Order 12372, as amended by Executive Order 12416 (3 CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 197 and 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 186) (Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 52, allow each State to establish its own process for review and comment on proposed Federal financial assistance programs. 

### (b) Applicability. {#sec-357-b}

Executive Order 12372 applies to applications submitted with respect to HOME funds being competitively reallocated under subpart J of this part to units of general local government. 

## § 92.358 Consultant activities. {#sec-358}

No person providing consultant services in an employer-employee type relationship shall receive more than a reasonable rate of compensation for personal services paid with HOME funds. In no event, however, shall such compensation exceed the limits in effect under the provisions of any applicable statute (e.g., annual HUD appropriations acts which have set the limit at the equivalent of the daily rate paid for Level IV of the Executive Schedule, see the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997, Pub. L. 104–204 (September 26, 1996)). Such services shall be evidenced by written agreements between the parties which detail the responsibilities, standards, and compensation. Consultant services provided under an independent contractor relationship are not subject to the compensation limitation of Level IV of the Executive Schedule. 

## § 92.359 VAWA requirements. {#sec-359}

### (a) General. {#sec-359-a}

(1) The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply to all HOME tenant-based rental assistance and rental housing assisted with HOME funds, as supplemented by this section. 

(2) For the HOME program, the “covered housing provider,” as this term is used in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, refers to: 

    (i) The housing owner for the purposes of 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(1), (d)(3), and (d)(4) and § 5.2009(a); and 

    (ii) The participating jurisdiction and the owner for purposes of 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(2), 5.2005(e), and 5.2007, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section. 

### (b) Effective date. {#sec-359-b}

The core statutory protections of VAWA that prohibit denial or termination of assistance or eviction solely because an applicant or tenant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking became applicable upon enactment of VAWA 2013 on March 7, 2013. Compliance with the VAWA regulatory requirements under this section and 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, are required for any tenant-based rental assistance or rental housing project for which the date of the HOME funding commitment is on or after December 16, 2016. 

### (c) Notification requirements. {#sec-359-c}

The participating jurisdiction must provide a notice and certification form that meet the requirements of 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the owner of HOME-assisted rental housing. 

(1) For HOME-assisted units.  The owner of HOME-assisted rental housing must provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the applicant for a HOME-assisted unit at the time the applicant is admitted to a HOME-assisted unit, or denied admission to a HOME-assisted unit based on the owner's tenant selection policies and criteria. The owner of HOME-assisted rental housing must also provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005 with any notification of eviction from a HOME-assisted unit. 

(2) For HOME tenant-based rental assistance.  The participating jurisdiction must provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the applicant for HOME tenant-based rental assistance when the applicant's HOME tenant-based rental assistance is approved or denied. The participating jurisdiction must also provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to a tenant receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance when the participating jurisdiction provides the tenant with notification of termination of the HOME tenant-based rental assistance, and when the participating jurisdiction learns that the tenant's housing owner intends to provide the tenant with notification of eviction. 

### (d) Bifurcation of lease requirements. {#sec-359-d}

For the purposes of this part, the following requirements shall apply in place of the requirements at 24 CFR 5.2009(b): 

(1) If a family living in a HOME-assisted rental unit separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the remaining tenant(s) may remain in the HOME-assisted unit. 

(2) If a family who is receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the remaining tenant(s) will retain the HOME tenant-based rental assistance. The participating jurisdiction must determine whether the tenant that was removed from the unit will receive HOME tenant-based rental assistance. 

### (e) VAWA lease term/addendum. {#sec-359-e}

The participating jurisdiction must develop a VAWA lease term/addendum to incorporate all requirements that apply to the owner or lease under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and this section, including the prohibited bases for eviction and restrictions on construing lease terms under 24 CFR 5.2005(b) and (c). This VAWA lease term/addendum must also provide that the tenant may terminate the lease without penalty if the participating jurisdiction determines that the tenant has met the conditions for an emergency transfer under 24 CFR 5.2005(e). When HOME tenant-based rental assistance is provided, the lease term/addendum must require the owner to notify the participating jurisdiction before the owner bifurcates the lease or provides notification of eviction to the tenant. If HOME tenant-based rental assistance is the only assistance provided (i.e., the unit is not receiving project-based assistance under a covered housing program, as defined in 24 CFR 5.2003), the VAWA lease term/addendum may be written to expire at the end of the rental assistance period. 

### (f) Period of applicability. {#sec-359-f}

For HOME-assisted rental housing, the requirements of this section shall apply to the owner of the housing for the duration of the affordability period. For HOME tenant-based rental assistance, the requirements of this section shall apply to the owner of the tenant's housing for the period for which the rental assistance is provided. 

### (g) Emergency Transfer Plan. {#sec-359-g}

(1) The participating jurisdiction must develop and implement an emergency transfer plan and must make the determination of whether a tenant qualifies under the plan. The plan must meet the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), as supplemented by this section. 

(2) For the purposes of § 5.2005(e)(7), the required policies must specify that for tenants who qualify for an emergency transfer and who wish to make an external emergency transfer when a safe unit is not immediately available, the participating jurisdiction must provide a list of properties in the jurisdiction that include HOME-assisted units. The list must include the following information for each property: The property's address, contact information, the unit sizes (number of bedrooms) for the HOME-assisted units, and, to the extent known, any tenant preferences or eligibility restrictions for the HOME-assisted units. In addition, the participating jurisdiction may: 

    (i) Establish a preference under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program for tenants who qualify for emergency transfers under 24 CFR 5.2005(e); 

    (ii) Provide HOME tenant-based rental assistance to tenants who qualify for emergency transfers under 24 CFR 5.2005(e); or 

    (iii) Coordinate with victim service providers and advocates to develop the emergency transfer plan, make referrals, and facilitate emergency transfers to safe and available units.

(b) A jurisdiction that is not a participating jurisdiction but is meeting the requirements of §§ [92.102](#sec-102), [92.103](#sec-103), and [92.104](#sec-104), (participation threshold, notice of intent, and submission of consolidated plan) is treated as a participating jurisdiction for purposes of receiving a reallocation under subpart J of this part. 

## § 92.451 Reallocation of HOME funds from a jurisdiction that is not designated a participating jurisdiction or has its designation revoked. {#sec-451}

### (a) Failure to be designated a participating jurisdiction. {#sec-451-a}

HUD will reallocate, under this section, any HOME funds allocated to or reserved for a jurisdiction that is not a participating jurisdiction if: 

(1) HUD determines that the jurisdiction has failed to: 

    (i) Meet the participation threshold amount in [§ 92.102](#sec-102); 

    (ii) Provide notice of its intent to become a participating jurisdiction in accordance with [§ 92.103](#sec-103); or 

    (iii) Submit its consolidated plan, in accordance with 24 CFR part 91; or 

(2) HUD after providing for amendments and resubmissions in accordance with 24 CFR part 91 disapproves the jurisdiction's consolidated plan. 

### (b) Designation revoked. {#sec-451-b}

HUD will reallocate, under this section, any funds remaining in a jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund after HUD has revoked the jurisdiction's designation as a participating jurisdiction under [§ 92.107](#sec-107). 

### (c) Manner of reallocation. {#sec-451-c}

HUD will reallocate funds that are subject to reallocation under this section in the following manner: 

(1) If the funds to be reallocated under this section are from a State, HUD will: 

    (i) Make the funds available by competition in accordance with criteria in [§ 92.453](#sec-453) among applications submitted by units of general local government within the State and with preference being given to applications from units of general local government that are not participating jurisdictions, and 

    (ii) Reallocate the remainder by formula in accordance with [§ 92.454](#sec-454). 

(2) If the funds to be reallocated are from a unit of general local government: 

    (i) Located in a State that is participating jurisdiction, HUD will reallocate the funds to that State. The State, in distributing these funds, must give preference to the provision of affordable housing within the unit of general local government; or 

    (ii) Located in a State that is not a participating jurisdiction, HUD will reallocate the funds by competition among units of general local government and community housing development organizations within the State, with priority going to applications for affordable housing within the unit of general local government; and reallocate the remainder by formula in accordance with [§ 92.454](#sec-454). 

## § 92.452 Reallocation of community housing development organization set-aside. {#sec-452}

HUD will reallocate, under this section, any HOME funds reduced or recaptured by HUD from a participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund under § 92.300(d). HUD will reallocate these funds by competition in accordance with criteria in § 92.453 to other participating jurisdictions for affordable housing developed, sponsored, or owned by community housing development organizations. 

## § 92.453 Competitive reallocations. {#sec-453}

(a) HUD will invite applications through Federal Register publication of a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA), in accordance with section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) and the requirements of sec. 217(c) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12747(c)), for HOME funds that become available for competitive reallocation under § 92.451 or § 92.452, or both. The NOFA will describe the application requirements and procedures, including the total funding available for the competition and any maximum amount of individual awards. The NOFA will also describe the selection criteria and any special factors to be evaluated in awarding points under the selection criteria. 

(b) The NOFA will include the selection criteria at sec. 217(c) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12747(c)), with the following maximum number of points awarded for each category of criteria: 

(1) Commitment.  Up to 25 points for the criteria at sec. 217(c)(1) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12747(c)(1)); 

(2) Actions.  Up to 50 points for the criteria at sec. 217(c)(2) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12747(c)(2)); and

## § 92.454 Reallocations by formula. {#sec-454}

(a) HUD will reallocate under this section: 

    (1) Any HOME funds remaining available for reallocation after HUD has made competitive reallocations under [§ 92.451](#sec-451) and [§ 92.452](#sec-452);

    (2) Any HOME funds available for reallocation because HUD reduced or recaptured funds from participating jurisdiction under [§ 92.500(d)](#sec-500-d) for failure to commit the funds within the time specified; 

    (3) Any HOME funds withdrawn by HUD from a participating jurisdiction under 24 CFR 91.520(f) for failure to submit in a timely manner a performance report required by 24 CFR 91.520 that is satisfactory to HUD; and 

    (4) Any HOME funds remitted to HUD under [§ 92.503(b)](#sec-503-b) when a jurisdiction ceases to be a participating jurisdiction. 

(b) Any reallocation of funds from a State must be made only among all participating States, and any reallocation of funds from units of general local government must be made only among all participating units of general local government, except those participating jurisdictions that HUD has removed from participating in reallocations under [§ 92.552](#sec-552). 

(c) A local participating jurisdiction's share of a reallocation is calculated by multiplying the amount available for reallocation to units of general local government by a factor that is that ratio of the participating jurisdiction's formula allocation provided under [§ 92.50](#sec-50) to the total of the formula allocations provided for all local participating jurisdictions sharing in the reallocation. A State participating jurisdiction's share is comparably determined using the amount available for reallocation to States. 

(d) HUD will make reallocations under this section quarterly, unless the amount available for such reallocation is insufficient to warrant making a reallocation. In any event, HUD will make a reallocation under this section at least once a year. The minimum amount of a reallocation is $1000. 

# Subpart K—Program Administration {#subpart-k}

## § 92.500 The HOME Investment Trust Fund. {#sec-500}

### (a) General. {#sec-500-a}

A HOME Investment Trust Fund consists of the accounts described in this section solely for investment in accordance with the provisions of this part. HUD will establish a HOME Investment Trust Fund United States Treasury account for each participating jurisdiction. Each participating jurisdiction may use either a separate local HOME Investment Trust Fund account or, a subsidiary account within its general fund (or other appropriate fund) as the local HOME Investment Trust Fund account. 

### (b) Treasury Account. {#sec-500-b}

The United States Treasury account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund includes funds allocated to the participating jurisdiction under [§ 92.50](#sec-50) (including for a local participating jurisdiction, any transfer of the State's allocation pursuant to [§ 92.102(b)(2)](#sec-102-b-2) and funds reallocated to the participating jurisdiction, either by formula or by competition, under subpart J of this part; and 

### (c) Local account. {#sec-500-c}

(1) The local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund includes deposits of HOME funds disbursed from the Treasury account; the deposit of any State funds (other than HOME funds transferred pursuant to [§ 92.102(b)(2)](#sec-102-b-2) or local funds that enable the jurisdiction to meet the participating threshold amount in § 92.102, any program income (from both the allocated funds and matching contributions in accordance with the definition of program income), and any repayments or recaptured funds as required by [§ 92.503](#sec-503). The local account must be interest-bearing. 

(2) The participating jurisdiction may establish a second local account of the HOME Investment Trust Funds if: 

    (i) The participating jurisdiction has its own affordable housing trust fund that the participating jurisdiction will use for matching contributions to the HOME program; 

    (ii) The statute or local ordinance requires repayments from its own trust fund to be made to the trust fund; 

    (iii) The participating jurisdiction establishes a separate account within its own trust fund for repayments of the matching contributions; and 

    (iv) The funds in the account are used solely for investment in eligible activities within the participating jurisdiction's boundaries in accordance with the provisions of this part, except as provided under § 92.201(a)(2). 

(3) The funds in the local account cannot be used for the matching contribution and do not need to be matched. 

### (d) {#sec-500-d}

(1) Reductions of Fiscal Year 2015 and subsequent fiscal year allocations.  HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund, as follows: 

    (i) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not committed (including funds for community housing development organizations under [§ 92.300](#sec-300)) within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation; 

    (ii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that were committed to a State recipient or subrecipient that are not committed to a specific local project within 36 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation; 

    (iii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not expended (drawn down) by September 30 of the fifth year after the end of the period of availability of the fiscal year allocation for obligation by HUD. Due to end-of-year financial system closeouts that begin before this date and prevent electronic access to the payment system, requests to draw down the funds must be made at least 7 full business days before this date to ensure that the funds still can be drawn from the United States Treasury account through the computerized disbursement and information system; and 

    (iv) Any penalties assessed by HUD under [§ 92.552](#sec-552). 

(2) 

    (i) Reductions of Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations.  HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund by the amount of: 

        (A) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are required to be reserved (i.e., 15 percent of the funds) by a participating jurisdiction, under [§ 92.300](#sec-300), and which are not committed to a community housing development organization project within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; 

        (B) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are not committed within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; 

        (C) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are not expended within 5 years after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; and 

        (D) Any penalties assessed by HUD under [§ 92.552](#sec-552). 

    (ii) For purposes of determining the amount by which the HOME Investment Trust Fund will be reduced or recaptured under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section, HUD will consider the sum of commitments to CHDOs, commitments, or expenditures, as applicable, from all fiscal year allocations through the Fiscal Year 2014 allocation. This sum must be equal to or greater than the sum of all fiscal year allocations through the fiscal year allocation being examined (minus previous reductions to the HOME Investment Trust Fund), or in the case of commitments to CHDOs, 15 percent of those fiscal year allocations. 

    (iii) HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund by the amount of all fiscal year allocations through the Fiscal Year 2014 allocation that are uncommitted by the commitment deadline for the Fiscal Year 2015 allocation. 

## § 92.501 HOME Investment Partnership Agreement. {#sec-501}

Allocated and reallocated funds will be made available pursuant to a HOME Investment Partnership Agreement. The agreement ensures that HOME funds invested in affordable housing are repayable if the housing ceases to qualify as affordable housing before the period of affordability expires. 

## § 92.502 Program disbursement and information system. {#sec-502}

### (a) General.  {#sec-502-a}

The HOME Investment Trust Fund account established in the United States Treasury is managed through a computerized disbursement and information system established by HUD. The system disburses HOME funds that are allocated or reallocated, and collects and reports information on the use of HOME funds in the United States Treasury account. (For purposes of reporting in the Integrated Disbursement and Information System, a HOME project is an activity.) The participating jurisdiction must report all program income in HUD's computerized disbursement and information system. 

### (b) Project set-up.  {#sec-502-b}

After the participating jurisdiction executes the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement, submits the applicable banking and security documents, complies with the environmental requirements under 24 CFR part 58 for release of funds and commits funds to a specific local project, the participating jurisdiction may identify (set up) specific investments in the disbursement and information system. Investments that require the set-up of projects in the system are the acquisition, new construction, or rehabilitation of housing, and the provision of tenant-based rental assistance. The participating jurisdiction is required to enter complete project set-up information at the time of project set-up. 

### (c) Disbursement of HOME funds. {#sec-502-c}

(1) After complete project set-up information is entered into the disbursement and information system, HOME funds for the project may be drawn down from the United States Treasury account by the participating jurisdiction by electronic funds transfer. The funds will be deposited in the local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund of the participating jurisdiction within 48 to 72 hours of the disbursement request. Any drawdown of HOME funds from the United States Treasury account is conditioned upon the provision of satisfactory information by the participating jurisdiction about the project or tenant-based rental assistance and compliance with other procedures, as specified by HUD. 

(2) HOME funds drawn from the United States Treasury account must be expended for eligible costs within 15 days. Any interest earned within the 15-day period may be retained by the participating jurisdiction as HOME funds. Any funds that are drawn down and not expended for eligible costs within 15 days of the disbursement must be returned to HUD for deposit in the participating jurisdiction's United States Treasury account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund. Interest earned after 15 days belongs to the United States and must be remitted to the United States as provided in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(9), except interest amounts up to $500 per year may be retained for administrative expenses. 

(3) HOME funds in the local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund must be disbursed before requests are made for HOME funds in the United States Treasury account. Beginning with the Fiscal Year 2015 allocation, the specific funds that are committed to a project will be disbursed for that project. If both funds in the local account and funds in the United States Treasury account are committed to a project, the funds in the local account must be disbursed before requests are made for HOME funds in the United States Treasury account for the project. 

(4) A participating jurisdiction will be paid on an advance basis provided it complies with the requirements of this part. 

### (d) Project completion. {#sec-502-d}

(1) Complete project completion information must be entered into the disbursement and information system, or otherwise provided, within 120 days of the final project drawdown. If satisfactory project completion information is not provided, HUD may suspend further project set-ups or take other corrective actions. 

(2) Additional HOME funds may be committed to a project up to one year after project completion, but the amount of HOME funds in the project may not exceed the maximum per-unit subsidy amount established under § 92.250. 

### (e) Access by other participants. {#sec-502-e}

Access to the disbursement and information system by other entities participating in the HOME program (e.g., State recipients) will be governed by procedures established by HUD. Only participating jurisdictions and State recipients (if permitted by the State) may request disbursement. 

## § 92.503 Program income, repayments, and recaptured funds. {#sec-503}

### (a) Program income. {#sec-503-a}

(1) Program income must be used in accordance with the requirements of this part. Program income must be deposited in the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund local account unless the participating jurisdiction permits the State recipient or subrecipient to retain the program income for additional HOME projects pursuant to the written agreement required by [§ 92.504](#sec-504). 

(2) If the jurisdiction is not a participating jurisdiction when the program income is received, the funds are not subject to the requirements of this part. 

(3) Program income derived from consortium activities undertaken by or within a member unit of general local government which thereafter terminates its participation in the consortium continues to be program income of the consortium. 

### (b) Repayments. {#sec-503-b}

(1) Any HOME funds invested in housing that does not meet the affordability requirements for the period specified in [§ 92.252](#sec-252) or § [92.254](#sec-254), as applicable, must be repaid by the participating jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 

(2) Any HOME funds invested in a project that is terminated before completion, either voluntarily or otherwise, must be repaid by the participating jurisdiction, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except for repayments of project-specific community housing development organization loans that are waived, in accordance with §§ 92.301(a)(3) and (b)(3). In addition, any HOME funds used for costs that are not eligible under this part must be repaid by the participating jurisdiction, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 

(3) HUD will instruct the participating jurisdiction to either repay the funds to the HOME Investment Trust Fund Treasury account or the local account. If the jurisdiction is not a participating jurisdiction at the time the repayment is made, the funds must be remitted to HUD and reallocated, in accordance with [§ 92.454](#sec-454). 

### (c) Recaptures. {#sec-503-c}

HOME funds recaptured in accordance with § 92.254(a)(5)(ii) must be used in accordance with the requirements of this part. Recaptured funds must be deposited in the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund local account unless the participating jurisdiction permits the State recipient, subrecipient, or community housing development organization to retain the recaptured funds for additional HOME projects pursuant to the written agreement required by [§ 92.504](#sec-504). If the jurisdiction is not a participating jurisdiction when the recaptured funds are received, the funds must be remitted to HUD and reallocated in accordance with [§ 92.454](#sec-454). 

### (d) Commitment of funds in the local account. {#sec-503-d}

Beginning with the Fiscal Year 2017 action plan, as provided in 24 CFR 91.220(l)(2) and 91.320(k)(2), program income, repayments, and recaptured funds in the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund local account must be used in accordance with the requirements of this part, and the amount of program income, repayments, and recaptured funds in the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund local account at the beginning of the program year must be committed before HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund United States Treasury account, except for the HOME funds in the United States Treasury account that are required to be reserved (i.e., 15 percent of the funds), under § 92.300(a), for investment only in housing to be owned, developed, or sponsored by community housing development organizations. The deadline for committing program income, repayments, and recaptured funds received during a program year is the date of the participating jurisdiction's commitment deadline for the subsequent year's grant allocation. 

## § 92.504 Participating jurisdiction responsibilities; written agreements; on-site inspection. {#sec-504}

### (a) Responsibilities.  {#sec-504-a}

The participating jurisdiction is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of its HOME program, ensuring that HOME funds are used in accordance with all program requirements and written agreements, and taking appropriate action when performance problems arise. The use of State recipients, subrecipients, or contractors does not relieve the participating jurisdiction of this responsibility. The performance and compliance of each contractor, State recipient, and subrecipient must be reviewed at least annually. The participating jurisdiction must have and follow written policies, procedures, and systems, including a system for assessing risk of activities and projects and a system for monitoring entities consistent with this section, to ensure that the requirements of this part are met. 

### (b) Executing a written agreement.  {#sec-504-b}

Before disbursing any HOME funds to any entity, the participating jurisdiction must enter into a written agreement with that entity. Before disbursing any HOME funds to any entity, a State recipient, subrecipient, or contractor which is administering all or a part of the HOME program on behalf of the participating jurisdiction, must also enter into a written agreement with that entity. The written agreement must ensure compliance with the requirements of this part. 

### (c) Provisions in written agreements.  {#sec-504-c}

The contents of the agreement may vary depending upon the role the entity is asked to assume or the type of project undertaken. This section details basic requirements by role and the minimum provisions that must be included in a written agreement. 

#### (1) State recipient. {#sec-504-c-1}

The provisions in the written agreement between the State and a State recipient will depend on the program functions that the State specifies the State recipient will carry out in accordance with § 92.201(b). In accordance with § 92.201, the written agreement must either require the State recipient to comply with the requirements established by the State or require the State recipient to establish its own requirements to comply with this part, including requirements for income determinations and underwriting subsidy layering guidelines, rehabilitation standards, refinancing guidelines, homebuyer program policies, and affordability.

### (b) Performance review. {#sec-551-b}

(1) If HUD determines preliminarily that the participating jurisdiction has not met a requirement of this part, the participating jurisdiction will be given notice of this determination and an opportunity to demonstrate, within the time prescribed by HUD (not to exceed 30 days) and on the basis of substantial facts and data, that it has done so. 

(2) If the participating jurisdiction fails to demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that it has met the requirement, HUD will take corrective or remedial action in accordance with this section or [§ 92.552](#sec-552). 

### (c) Corrective and remedial actions. {#sec-551-c}

Corrective or remedial actions for a performance deficiency (failure to meet a provision of this part) will be designed to prevent a continuation of the deficiency; mitigate, to the extent possible, its adverse effects or consequences; and prevent its recurrence.

    (vii) Establishing procedures to ensure compliance with HOME requirements; 

    (viii) Making matching contributions as draws are made from the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund United States Treasury Account and establishing a remedial plan to make up the matching contributions deficit; and 

    (ix) If the participating jurisdiction is a metropolitan city, forming a consortium with the urban county if the urban county is willing to carry out the HOME program in the metropolitan city. 

(2) HUD may also change the method of payment from an advance to reimbursement basis and may require supporting documentation to be submitted for HUD review for each payment request before payment is made; determine the participating jurisdiction to be high risk and impose special conditions or restrictions on the next year's allocation in accordance with 2 CFR 200.207; and take other remedies that may be legally available, including remedies under 2 CFR 200.338.

Provided, however, that HUD may on due notice suspend payments at any time after the issuance of a notice of opportunity for hearing pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, pending such hearing and a final decision, to the extent HUD determines such action necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for activities affected by the failure to comply. 

(b) Proceedings.  When HUD proposes to take action pursuant to this section, the respondent in the proceedings will be the participating jurisdiction or, at HUD's option, the State recipient. Proceedings will be conducted in accordance with 24 CFR part 26.
